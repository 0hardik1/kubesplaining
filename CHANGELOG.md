# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). v1.0.x patch releases use auto-generated commit-grouped notes (driven by the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) prefix on each commit); only minor/major releases carry a hand-curated narrative section here.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Privesc paths no longer confuse holding a ServiceAccount's token with running inside its pods.** One graph node stood for both, so any route that reached a ServiceAccount could continue through `pod_host_escape` from a privileged pod that runs as it. A subject that could only mint the SA's token (`token_request`), impersonate it, steer a controller that runs as it, or create a new, unprivileged pod as it was reported as reaching node escape through a pod it never entered. Edges now declare the foothold they need and the foothold they give (the SA's API identity, a shell in its existing pods, or a new pod created as it), and path search walks an edge only when the attacker holds one it needs. Exec, attach, ephemeral containers, and namespace-admin still reach an existing pod's host escape. The IMDS pivot now needs code in a pod, existing or new, so a minted token or an impersonation no longer reaches it either.
- **Exec into a pod that mounts no API token no longer hands over the ServiceAccount's RBAC.** `pod_exec` and `ephemeral_container_inject` edges ignored `automountServiceAccountToken`. They now give the SA's identity only when one of its pods carries an API token, by the admission plugin's rule (the pod's setting wins, then the ServiceAccount's, then `true`; a projected `serviceAccountToken` volume with no audience counts too). A shell in a token-less pod still reaches that pod's own host escape and, on EKS, its IRSA role and IMDS, since the IRSA webhook projects its own token whatever the automount setting is.
- **Impersonating a ServiceAccount, or steering a controller that runs as it, no longer reaches its AWS IAM role.** The foothold model split the API identity into acting as the SA versus holding a token for it. `sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` needs a signed OIDC token, which impersonation and the confused-deputy `operator_reconcile` bridge do not mint, so neither reaches the `irsa_assume_role` edge any more. Minting a token through the TokenRequest API (`create serviceaccounts/token`), a shell in one of the SA's pods, or a new pod created as it still reach it, since each is or yields a presentable credential.
- **Grants to `system:authenticated` and `system:serviceaccounts[:<ns>]` now reach their members in the privesc graph.** The API server adds these groups to requests by itself, so no binding lists the members, and path search skipped the group nodes as `system:` subjects. A binding that gave every ServiceAccount in a namespace `list secrets`, or gave every authenticated user cluster-admin, produced no path, and the standard exclusions preset hid the flat finding on the group. Each member now has an `implicit_group_membership` edge to its groups, so the grant shows up as a path from every ServiceAccount (and, for `system:authenticated`, every User) it reaches, including members reached mid-chain. The remediation hint for such a path drops the group from the binding that grants it. `system:unauthenticated` is not modeled: only anonymous requests carry it, and no subject in the graph makes them. A conjunction edge whose two halves come one from the member and one from the group (for example `create rolebindings` on the member and `bind` on the group) is not detected yet.
- **Workload controllers now have privesc graph edges.** `KUBE-PRIVESC-003` was a flat finding with nothing behind it in the graph, so a subject that could `create deployments` but not `create pods` had no path, even though the Deployment's controller creates the same pods. `create` on Deployments, DaemonSets, StatefulSets, Jobs, or CronJobs now reaches every ServiceAccount in scope (`workload_create_token_theft`). `update` or `patch` on an existing Deployment, DaemonSet, StatefulSet, or CronJob reaches every ServiceAccount in that workload's namespace, since the writer can re-point the template (`workload_hijack`). When the workload's own template already has host access and Pod Security admits it, it also reaches that host access. Both reach node escape in a namespace that admits privileged pods (`workload_privileged_escape`). Jobs are left out of the update edges because a Job's pod template cannot change after creation. `resourceNames` on an update grant scopes it to the named workloads. The workload edges are added after the pod edges, so a subject that holds both keeps its reported route; the workload edge still counts when the cut-resilient pass removes the pod edge's binding.
- **`create pods/exec` scoped with `resourceNames` no longer reaches every workload identity.** The exec and ephemeral-container edges were drawn to every ServiceAccount any pod ran as, ignoring `resourceNames`, so a break-glass grant on one debug pod fabricated a path into every co-located identity. The edges now honor `resourceNames`: a name-scoped grant reaches only the named pods' ServiceAccounts, while an unrestricted grant is unchanged.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-09-22

This release closes two detection gaps. The first opened when Kubernetes v1.36 promoted `MutatingAdmissionPolicy` to GA: the in-process CEL/JSONPatch mutator has now shipped on two upstream minors (v1.36 and v1.37) and on EKS, and until now a subject able to write both halves of one was invisible to every rule in the tool. The second is on EKS: a cluster that grants IAM principals access through EKS Access Entries instead of the `aws-auth` ConfigMap came back clean from every IAM-to-RBAC rule. The scanner now reads an access-entry export, and reports when it has none. Alongside the new rules, a correctness pass over the privesc graph removes two edge families that claimed routes the API server refuses, and closes a silent false negative for aggregated ClusterRoles in manifest-sourced snapshots.

### Added

- **EKS Access Entries (`KUBE-CLOUD-ACCESSENTRY-*`).** The `KUBE-CLOUD-AWSAUTH-*` family read `kube-system/aws-auth` only, so a cluster migrated to [EKS Access Entries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/access-entries.html), which is where AWS points every new cluster, came back clean from the whole IAM-to-RBAC class rather than reporting no data. Access entries live in the EKS API, not in the cluster, so the scanner now reads an export: `scripts/eks-access-entries.sh <cluster> > entries.json` (four read-only `eks:*` actions) and `scan --eks-access-entries entries.json`. Three rules follow. `KUBE-CLOUD-ACCESSENTRY-CLUSTER-ADMIN-001` (HIGH) flags `AmazonEKSClusterAdminPolicy` at cluster scope, the exact equivalent of a ClusterRoleBinding to `cluster-admin` that no Kubernetes object records. `KUBE-CLOUD-ACCESSENTRY-OVERBROAD-001` (MEDIUM) flags the two one-step-removed shapes: a cluster-scoped `AmazonEKSAdminPolicy` / `AmazonEKSAdminViewPolicy`, which reads every namespace's Secrets and so every kube-system controller token, and a `kubernetesGroups` entry that a ClusterRoleBinding ties to an admin-equivalent ClusterRole. `KUBE-CLOUD-ACCESSENTRY-NOT-EVALUATED-001` fires on every EKS scan that has no export loaded, so the report says what it could not see. It is LOW in both cases, never INFO, because the default severity threshold hides INFO and a hidden coverage-gap finding is no finding; the score and description say whether `aws-auth` was absent too (no IAM-to-RBAC rule ran at all) or analyzed. The privesc graph gains `access_entry_admin` and `access_entry_secrets_read` edges from the external IAM node, structured remediation hints emit the `aws eks disassociate-access-policy` / `update-access-entry` calls, and the export's `authenticationMode` now gates the aws-auth rules: in `API` mode the apiserver ignores the ConfigMap, so those findings and edges stand down instead of reporting a mapping that grants nothing.
- **`KUBE-PRIVESC-019`: mutating admission policy injection.** Kubesplaining was blind to `MutatingAdmissionPolicy`, the webhookless CEL/JSONPatch mutator that went GA (`admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1`) in Kubernetes v1.36 and is available on EKS. Unlike a mutating webhook it carries its mutation in etcd and runs in-process, so a subject that can write both `mutatingadmissionpolicies` and `mutatingadmissionpolicybindings` can inject `privileged: true`, a `hostPath`, or a sidecar into every future pod at admission time. The collector now lists both resources (they degrade to a warning on clusters that do not serve them, exactly as `ValidatingAdmissionPolicy` does), the snapshot carries them, the rbac analyzer emits a CRITICAL finding when a subject holds write access to both halves, and the privesc graph draws a `mutating_policy_inject` edge to `node_escape`. The edge is gated on at least one namespace Pod Security Admission does not restrict, because mutating admission runs before validating admission: the injected privileged pod still faces PSA, so it lands in an unlabeled or `privileged`-labelled namespace (which every cluster has). Both halves are required, mirroring why `KUBE-PRIVESC-010` needs the `bind` verb rather than a binding write alone.

### Fixed

- **Two privesc edge families claimed routes the API server refuses.** `modify_role_binding` and `bind_or_escalate` each fired from a single verb. Kubernetes runs an escalation-prevention check on every (Cluster)RoleBinding create and update: the writer must already hold every permission the referenced role grants, or hold `bind` on that role, and `escalate` is the same carve-out for role content. Each verb is inert alone. Both edges are now conjunctions built in a per-subject pass, since nothing makes a subject collect both halves through one binding. The flat `KUBE-PRIVESC-009` / `-010` findings still fire on the bare grant; only the claimed *path* is gone. The `namespace_admin` sink needs cluster-scoped `bind` on `clusterroles` for the same reason.
- **`impersonate` on users no longer reaches `cluster_admin` unconditionally.** No username is privileged by construction, so the edge is now one `impersonate_user` hop per User subject a binding actually names. `impersonate` on groups stays unconditional (`impersonate_system_masters`), since `system:masters` is impersonable whether or not any binding mentions it. On a stock kubeadm / kind cluster the admin identity rides on the group `kubeadm:cluster-admins` and no non-system User is bound, so the grant escalates nothing there.
- **Aggregated ClusterRoles were empty in manifest-sourced snapshots.** `permissions.Aggregate` read `clusterRole.rules` only. kube-controller-manager fills `.rules` for an aggregating ClusterRole on a live cluster, so live snapshots were fine, but a rendered chart or `scan-resource` input carries an empty `.rules` and the role registered as granting nothing: a silent false negative for every rule that reads effective permissions. `Aggregate` now expands `aggregationRule` when `.rules` is empty, trusts `.rules` when the controller has already reconciled it, and terminates on a ClusterRole whose own labels satisfy its own selector. `EffectiveRule` also carries `nonResourceURLs` instead of dropping them.
- **Cloud findings never carried a structured remediation hint.** `remediation.ForCloud` existed, with hints for every `KUBE-CLOUD-AWSAUTH-*` / `-IRSA-*` / `-IMDS-PIVOT-001` rule, but nothing called it, so `--remediation-patches` attached hints to every module except `cloud`. The cloud dispatcher now runs its findings through the generator like the other modules do.

### Changed

- **Krew index updates are automated.** The release workflow now runs `krew-release-bot` after GoReleaser publishes, rendering `.krew.yaml` against the published assets and opening the version-bump PR on `kubernetes-sigs/krew-index`. `kubectl krew install kubesplaining` is documented in the README.
- **Pull requests are gated on `make e2e`.** The kind-based end-to-end run (recall lists, ruleset goldens, deny guards, chain-shape assertions, the alternate-path invariant, and the remediation-patch rescan) now runs on every PR rather than only on merges to `main`.


## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-31

This release is the graph release. Two waves of privilege-escalation work landed on top of v1.1.0 and they compound: the first took the escalation graph across the cloud boundary (a first-class EKS module, so a chain can cross from a Kubernetes ServiceAccount into an AWS IAM role) and completed the 17-entry `KUBE-PRIVESC` technique taxonomy; the second taught the graph to chain deeply rather than stop at its first sink, to model a privileged operator as a confused deputy, and to check whether the fix each finding recommends actually closes the route it found. Alongside them the certificates API is now covered on both sides, permission and evidence, and scoring changed shape: a chain is ranked by its hardest hop rather than by how many hops it has.

Two entries deserve to be read before upgrading. `RemediationHint` emission became opt-in behind `--remediation-patches` (BREAKING in 0.x terms; see Changed), and `KUBE-PRIVESC-011`'s narrative was rewritten because it documented an attack that modern admission control blocks, which means anyone who dismissed that finding after a failed reproduction should look at it again.

### Added

- **EKS cloud-provider module (`internal/analyzer/cloud`, `cloud/eks`).** The first cloud-aware analyzer. It reads EKS-specific state and extends the privesc graph past the cluster edge:
  - **IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts).** `KUBE-CLOUD-IRSA-ADMIN-ROLE-001` flags a ServiceAccount annotated to assume an admin-equivalent IAM role; `KUBE-CLOUD-IRSA-MISSING-001` flags an IRSA annotation pointing at a role that cannot be resolved. A `ServiceAccount → IAM role` graph edge (`irsa_assume_role`) feeds the BFS so the assume-role step surfaces as a `KUBE-PRIVESC-PATH-AWS-IAM-ROLE` chain.
  - **aws-auth ConfigMap mapping.** The `kube-system/aws-auth` IAM-to-RBAC map is parsed to name the offending principals: `KUBE-CLOUD-AWSAUTH-SYSTEM-MASTERS-001` (an IAM principal mapped straight to `system:masters`), `KUBE-CLOUD-AWSAUTH-OVERBROAD-001` (mapped to a group bound to an admin-equivalent ClusterRole), and `KUBE-CLOUD-AWSAUTH-PARSE-ERROR-001` (malformed map). `external IAM principal → system:masters / cluster-admin` edges wire these into the graph.
  - **IMDS pivot.** `KUBE-CLOUD-IMDS-PIVOT-001` detects a pod that can reach the node instance-metadata endpoint (`169.254.169.254`) to steal the node IAM role. `KUBE-CLOUD-PROVIDER-UNKNOWN-001` records when the provider could not be identified.
  - External IAM nodes are modeled as terminal sinks with controlled traversal, so a chain can enter AWS without laundering back through the control plane.

- **Completed `KUBE-PRIVESC` technique taxonomy (7 new IDs) + Escalation Paths report tab.** Adds `KUBE-PRIVESC-002` (create pods into a namespace whose Pod Security Admission does not block privileged pods), `-004` (create/get on `pods/exec` or `pods/attach`), `-006` (get-only on secrets, split out of `-005` which is now list/watch), `-007` (create + get on secrets: mint a legacy token Secret pointed at a privileged SA, then read the token), `-013` (update/patch on `pods/ephemeralcontainers`), `-015` (create on `pods/portforward`), and `-016` (delete pods + node status write / delete: evict and reschedule onto an attacker node). New graph edges (`-002`, `-007`, `-013`, `-016`) feed the BFS so these surface as `KUBE-PRIVESC-PATH-*` chains. The HTML report gains a CSS-tab-gated **Escalation paths** tab listing every `KUBE-PRIVESC-PATH-*` chain, grouped by sink and sorted by danger.

- **Deep escalation chains.** The privesc graph now expresses multi-hop paths that were previously invisible. `namespace_admin` is no longer a dead-end sink: reaching it now continues into every ServiceAccount co-located in that namespace (`colocated_sa_token_theft`), which is what turns a namespace-bounded grant into a cluster-wide path when that namespace also hosts a privileged controller. Node escape continues into control-plane PKI theft (`control_plane_pki_theft` to `system:masters`, `static_pod_admission_bypass` to token mint), gated on the snapshot actually containing a control-plane node with no `NoSchedule` taint, so worker-only clusters are unaffected. Non-built-in ServiceAccounts in `kube-system` are now traversable as chain intermediates while still never being seeded as path-search sources.

- **`KUBE-CONFUSED-DEPUTY-001`.** Flags a subject that cannot escalate directly but can write a custom resource that a privileged operator then reconciles on its behalf. Catalog covers Flux, Argo CD, Argo Workflows, cert-manager, external-secrets, Velero, Tekton, and prometheus-operator `ServiceMonitor` (the `bearerTokenFile` token-exfiltration vector, GHSA-cxh2-4639-vmc5). Detection is RBAC-only and requires the operator's controller ServiceAccount to exist in the cluster, so a stray grant on an uninstalled CRD produces nothing.

- **Cut-resilient escalation paths.** Every privesc finding recommends cutting the (Cluster)RoleBinding that granted its chain's first hop. The tool now checks whether that fix actually closes the route: after the primary search, it re-runs per source with the recommended cut simulated and reports any route that still reaches the same sink as `alternate_escalation_path`, tagged `privesc:survives-first-cut`. A finding can now state that its own recommended fix is insufficient, and show the route that survives it. The simulated cut is source-scoped, modeling "remove this subject from that binding" rather than deleting the binding, so it matches exactly what the remediation prints. A surviving alternate deliberately changes no score and no severity: it is a field and a tag, because score already encodes reachability and chain length. The HTML report renders the surviving route beside the primary chain and names the binding whose cut was evaluated, and the searched depth (`--max-privesc-depth`) now appears in the report so an empty result can be read correctly. An empty `alternate_escalation_path` means no surviving route was found within the searched depth, never that the fix is provably sufficient.

- **`KUBE-PRIVESC-024`: signer control.** The certificates API has two mint paths and only one was modeled. Beyond "create a CSR and approve it" (`-011`), a subject holding `sign` on the `signers` resource for an apiserver-trusted client signer plus `update`/`patch` on `certificatesigningrequests/status` *is* the signer: it writes the issued certificate itself, with no approval step and no approver in the chain. That pair is exactly what the CertificateSigning admission plugin enforces, and it now emits a finding (CRITICAL for `kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client`, HIGH for the kubelet signers) plus a `csr_sign` graph edge to `system_masters`. The edge is rated `hard`: the certificate must chain to a CA in the apiserver's `--client-ca-file`, which the designated signer holds by definition but which a snapshot cannot confirm. Signer-name matching honors the `resourceNames` grammar the `signers` resource uses (exact name, `kubernetes.io/*`, `*/*`, unrestricted), so a grant pinned to a third-party signer does not fire.

- **`KUBE-CSR-001` / `-002` and the `certificates` module.** CertificateSigningRequest objects were collected but never analyzed, so the tool reported who *could* mint a client certificate and never that one had actually been requested. The new module reads them: `-001` flags a CSR submitted by a ServiceAccount against a signer whose certs authenticate to the apiserver (HIGH once approved, MEDIUM while pending, skipped when denied); `-002` flags any CSR naming `kubernetes.io/legacy-unknown`, the one client-auth signer CertificateSubjectRestriction does not inspect and therefore the only route left for an `O=system:masters` request. Both are deliberately narrow: node-bootstrap CSRs (`system:bootstrap:*` / `system:node:*`) and human certificate onboarding do not fire, which the e2e now guards against a live kubeadm cluster. Both findings state the two limits that apply: the raw CSR PEM is never collected, so the claimed Subject DN is unknown, and the CSR cleaner deletes issued CSRs about an hour after issuance, so an empty list proves nothing.

- **Structured remediation hints across every analyzer.** All eight modules (podsec, rbac, privesc, network, admission, secrets+configmap, serviceaccount, containersec) now attach a `RemediationHint` to each finding with one or more of: a `kubectl patch` payload (strategic-merge / merge / JSON), a Kyverno `ClusterPolicy`, a Gatekeeper `ConstraintTemplate` + `Constraint`, or a unified RBAC diff. JSON/SARIF expose the whole struct; HTML renders a per-finding "Structured remediation" section with collapsible `<details>` blocks per surface.

- **`--remediation-patches` opt-in flag.** Added to `scan`, `scan-resource`, and `report`. Off by default. Pass the flag to populate the hint on each emitted finding; the same flag controls render-time inclusion in `report` so a JSON saved with hints renders cleanly with or without them.

- **Live EKS demo walkthrough.** [`docs/eks-demo.md`](docs/eks-demo.md) walks a cross-namespace privesc chain that pivots into AWS via IRSA, end to end, against a real EKS cluster.

- **Precision / recall corpus (`make corpus`).** A deterministic, Docker-free scoring harness: labeled snapshots under `testdata/corpus/` pin the complete set of finding IDs each fixture should produce, plus an independently-authored deny list of shapes that must never fire. Precision and recall are gated at 1.0, so a new false positive and a lost true finding both fail the build. The e2e gained matching set-equality goldens over the rule-ID set for the same reason.

### Changed

- **RBAC matching is now `(apiGroup, resource, verb)`-aware and honors `resourceNames`.** A new shared matcher (`internal/permissions/matcher.go`) requires the API group, resource, and verb to all line up (wildcards on each axis), so a custom resource that reuses a core name (e.g. `secrets.example.com`) no longer trips the core-`secrets` checks. `resourceNames` is now modeled on the effective rule: a name-scoped grant cannot authorize collection verbs (list / watch / deletecollection, create on a top-level resource), so it no longer fires the broad "read / enumerate / create the whole resource type" checks. Name-scoped RBAC findings gain a `scope:resource-names` tag and attenuated blast radius, ranking below unrestricted grants of the same permission instead of vanishing. The rbac, serviceaccount, and privesc analyzers (and the SA remediation matcher) all route through this one matcher.

- **Escalation paths are now scored by their weakest hop rather than their length.** Each graph edge carries a difficulty rating, and a path's score is attenuated by the sum of its hops' difficulties instead of a flat penalty per hop. Severity now downgrades when a chain contains a genuinely hard step (one needing attacker-controlled infrastructure or a timing window), not merely because the chain is long. Previously a five-hop chain of trivial RBAC grants was ranked below a two-hop chain that required a race condition. `EscalationEdge` and `EscalationHop` gained a `difficulty` field, visible in JSON output.

- **`KUBE-PRIVESC-011` now describes the attack that works on a current cluster.** Its narrative, remediation, glossary entry, and attacker walkthrough all led with `O=system:masters`, which the CertificateSubjectRestriction admission plugin has rejected for the `kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client` signer since 1.19, so an operator reproducing the finding as written would have concluded it was not exploitable. The copy now leads with the Common Name, which nothing restricts: the apiserver maps a certificate's CN onto the username it authorizes without asking whether that identity is one Kubernetes would have issued, so `CN=system:serviceaccount:kube-system:<sa>` authenticates as that ServiceAccount and inherits its bindings. The finding also reports the second approval gate (`approve` on the CSR's `signers` resource, enforced by the CertificateApproval plugin since 1.19): a subject holding it is CRITICAL and fully enforced-authorized, one lacking it stays HIGH and is described as latent rather than live.

- **Chain amplification (`correlate`) is now causal.** Each `EscalationHop` carries the technique of the edge that enabled it, and the correlation pass amplifies a finding only when its own `(subject, rule)` is an actual edge of an escalation chain, rather than bumping every finding that merely shares a subject with a privesc path.

- **BREAKING (in 0.x): RemediationHint emission is now opt-in.** Earlier builds attached hints unconditionally for the podsec, rbac, and privesc modules. They are now gated behind `--remediation-patches` for consistency with the five new module wirings. To restore prior behavior pass `--remediation-patches` on `scan` / `scan-resource` / `report`.

### Fixed

- **Escalation edges are now emitted per granting binding.** Two graph builders collapsed to at most one edge per subject, so a capability granted by two bindings produced a single edge. Cutting it reported no survivor when one existed. Findings for a subject reachable through several bindings are now complete.

- **Two-rule correlation edges can be cut.** Edges derived from correlating two separate RBAC rules (secret mint, node drain-and-migrate, CSR approval) carry no single granting binding and were previously un-cuttable, so a chain through one always looked like it survived every fix. Each now records the sole grantor of each half where one exists (`CutBreakers`), so cutting that binding correctly breaks the correlation. Wildcard (`*/*/*`) bindings count as grantors for this purpose, so a half granted by both a wildcard and a narrow binding correctly has no sole grantor.

- **Confused-deputy findings from one subject no longer collapse into one.** Deduplication keyed several distinct findings together and could discard whichever one carried the surviving-route evidence. Findings carrying an escalation path now key on their own instance ID, since a chain is identified by its endpoints.

- **Analyzer output is deterministic.** Module results were collected in goroutine completion order and sorted with an unstable sort over a non-total comparator, so findings tying on severity, score, rule ID, and title could change position between identical runs. Results are now collected positionally, sorted stably, and tie-broken on finding ID. Two escalation-path outputs with the same ordering problem were fixed alongside it.

- **Analyzer-supplied strings are escaped in HTML evidence rows.** The Image and Scope rows passed values straight into a helper that writes raw HTML, and nothing downstream re-escaped them. A container image reference is attacker-controlled by anyone who can create a workload, so a hostile tag could inject markup into a report someone else opens.

- External IAM nodes are terminal sinks with proper traversal, so cloud identities cannot be used as intermediate hops to launder a path.

- `hostNetwork` IMDS reachability, custom wildcard-ClusterRole detection, and Fargate `ProviderID` parsing corrected in the cloud module.

- Per-subject capability cards in the Least Privilege tab restyled for consistent sizing.

### Documentation

- EKS demo (`docs/eks-demo.md`), cloud findings catalog entries in [`docs/findings.md`](docs/findings.md), and a privilege-escalation methodology-gap research note.

### Dependencies

- `github.com/google/cel-go` 0.28.1 → 0.29.2, `golang.org/x/text` 0.36.0 → 0.40.0, two rounds of `k8s.io` library-group bumps, and several CI action bumps (checkout, cache, setup-go, codeql-action, upload-artifact).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-16

This release expands kubesplaining from a detection tool into a delta-gated, remediation-aware assessment platform. The headline additions are: an audit-log-driven least-privilege analyzer (the AWS IAM Access Advisor analog for Kubernetes RBAC), a snapshot-diff `diff` command and `scan --baseline` flag so CI fails only on *new* findings, CEL-based `--custom-rules` for org-specific detections, Kyverno and Gatekeeper policy generators that turn findings into enforceable admission rules, and a new `containersec` analyzer module covering resource limits, probes, lifecycle hooks, and image pinning. A composite GitHub Action (`action.yml`) wraps the SARIF scan flow so you can wire kubesplaining into a workflow without authoring `docker run` invocations by hand.

### Added

- **`diff` command + `scan --baseline`** for CI delta gates. `kubesplaining diff old.json new.json` reports only new findings between two snapshots; `scan --baseline previous-findings.json` runs an analysis and fails the build only on findings that did not exist in the baseline. Pairs with `--ci-mode` so PR pipelines stop drifting on legacy findings nobody plans to fix today.

- **`--custom-rules` for CEL-based detections.** New `internal/analyzer/cel` module evaluates user-supplied CEL expressions against the snapshot, producing findings the same way built-in rules do. Ship a `.cel.yaml` rule next to your manifests; `kubesplaining scan --custom-rules ./rules/` picks them up. Example rules live in `examples/custom-rules/` (`no-default-namespace.cel.yaml`, `disallow-large-replica-counts.cel.yaml`).

- **`leastprivilege` analyzer module (audit-log driven).** Opt in via `--audit-log <path>` (kube-apiserver JSON-lines, or EKS CloudWatch export via `--audit-source eks`). The module compares RBAC granted to each ServiceAccount against verbs actually exercised in the audit window and flags the delta: `KUBE-RBAC-UNUSED-ROLE-001`, `KUBE-RBAC-UNUSED-RULE-001`, `KUBE-RBAC-UNUSED-VERB-001`, `KUBE-RBAC-WILDCARD-USED-PARTIAL-001`. A focused mode (`--least-privilege-only`) hides every other tab and lands on the Least Privilege view. See [`docs/audit-logs.md`](docs/audit-logs.md) for setup on kubeadm / kind / EKS.

- **`containersec` analyzer module.** New rules for resource limits absent, probes missing, lifecycle hook risk, and mutable image tags. Lives alongside `podsec` and shares its evidence schema.

- **`compliance` framework tags + Compliance tab.** Findings now carry CIS Kubernetes Benchmark and NSA Kubernetes Hardening Guidance control IDs where applicable; the HTML report adds a Compliance tab grouped by framework so auditors can pivot the findings list onto their existing control matrix.

- **Remediation generators (one library per policy engine).**
  - `internal/remediation/kubectl-patch`: kubectl-patch payloads for podsec rules (drop `privileged`, fix host namespaces, etc.).
  - `internal/remediation/kyverno`: Kyverno ClusterPolicy YAML for the same rule set, so you can paste the output into your policy bundle.
  - `internal/remediation/gatekeeper`: OPA Gatekeeper ConstraintTemplate + Constraint pairs.
  - `internal/remediation/rbac`: kubectl-patch and minimal-binding-diff generators for RBAC findings (smallest set of binding edits needed to remove a privesc edge).
  Each generator is invoked from the per-finding card in the HTML report; the JSON output exposes the generated payload under `properties.remediation`.

- **New analyzer rules across existing modules.**
  - `podsec`: `KUBE-PODSEC-CAPS-001` (dangerous Linux capabilities), readOnly-root-filesystem hardening, seccomp profile assessment, `procMount` overrides, PV-based hostPath bypass detection, Pod Security Admission namespace label assessment.
  - `secrets`: stale secret detection, cross-namespace secret access, TLS certificate expiry, ConfigMap credential heuristics.
  - `network`: cross-namespace traffic map, IMDS-endpoint egress detection (`169.254.169.254`).
  - `privesc`: CSR approval primitive (`KUBE-PRIVESC-011`) and the corresponding graph edges. A subject with `certificatesigningrequests/approval` can mint a high-privilege client cert; the analyzer now traces that to cluster-admin where applicable.
  - `rbac`: stale-binding detection (dangling `roleRef`, missing ServiceAccount subjects) under the new `KUBE-RBAC-STALE-*` rule family.

- **GitHub Action wrapper (`action.yml`).** Composite Action that pulls the pinned GHCR image and runs a scan against a live cluster (base64-encoded kubeconfig) or a snapshot JSON, with optional SARIF upload to GitHub code scanning. Drop into a workflow without hand-authoring the `docker run` form. Smoke-tested by `.github/workflows/action-smoke.yml`.

- **Report enhancements.**
  - Hero panel at the top of the HTML report highlights critical attack chains so the most actionable findings surface first.
  - Top-5-fixes panel groups remediation candidates by subject and resource so an operator sees the smallest set of changes that closes the most chains.
  - Per-subject capability cards in the Least Privilege tab spell out what a ServiceAccount can actually do.
  - Per-finding scoring tooltip explains how the composite score (`base × exploitability × blast_radius + chain_modifier`) was assembled.
  - Findings list capped to top 20 with category-balanced truncation so the report stays scannable; the full set remains in `findings.json`.
  - Per-subject finding groups and Least Privilege tables collapse by default for a calmer first view.

### Fixed

- `leastprivilege` no longer emits zero-event findings when the audit log contains no events for a subject; the module is a no-op in that case.
- Static-export HTML now gates JS-only interactivity copy (collapse/expand hints) so it does not appear when JavaScript is disabled.
- Font sizing inside Least Privilege finding cards normalized.
- Duplicate PersistentVolume entry removed from the glossary.
- GitHub Action container now runs as the host UID to avoid permission-denied writes when mounting `${{ github.workspace }}`.
- Action smoke test builds the image locally and skips the pull step when the image is already present.
- `errcheck` warning silenced on the stderr truncation-notice write path.

### Changed

- The e2e fixture is now split into per-feature manifest files (`testdata/e2e/vulnerable/00-baseline.yaml` through `14-csr.yaml`) with matching `.expect` / `.rollout` expectation files, replacing the single `testdata/e2e/vulnerable.yaml`. `scripts/kind-e2e.sh` rolls up each fixture, waits for its rollout, and asserts the rule IDs from the per-file expectation list.

### Documentation

- README rewritten for adoption: hero paragraph names the multi-hop-RBAC-graph differentiator, copy-pasteable from-clone install snippet, vs-alternatives table positioning against kubescape / trivy / polaris, and inspiration credits for [Kinnaird McQuade](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kmcquade3/) at BeyondTrust Phantom Labs and [Ramesh Ramani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rameshdotramani/) (who inspired the least-privilege mode).
- New `docs/audit-logs.md` covers enabling audit logging on self-managed / kubeadm, kind, and EKS clusters and exporting from CloudWatch.
- CLAUDE.md and README spell out CI gates not exercised by `make lint` (repo-wide golangci-lint, PR title length, repo-wide `go vet`).
- README documents when the `leastprivilege` module fires (with a behavior matrix across `scan`, `--audit-log`, `--least-privilege-only`, and `make scan-lp`).

### CI / Build

- Multi-stage Dockerfile (`Dockerfile.goreleaser`) for smaller release images.
- Release tag pattern in `.github/workflows/release.yml` tightened to match `v*.*.*` only.
- `example-report.yml` Pages workflow publishes the uncapped report so the Least Privilege tab is populated on the hosted demo.
- Dependabot bumps: `actions/setup-go` 5→6, `docker/setup-qemu-action` 3→4.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-30

First public release.

Kubesplaining is a Kubernetes security assessment CLI inspired by Salesforce's [Cloudsplaining](https://github.com/salesforce/cloudsplaining). It reads a live cluster (or a previously captured snapshot) and analyzes it against a library of techniques, emitting a prioritized list of findings as HTML, JSON, CSV, or SARIF.

The differentiator is **graph-based privilege-escalation path detection**: BFS from every non-system RBAC subject to five escalation sinks (cluster-admin, system:masters, node-escape, kube-system-secrets, token-mint), with the full hop chain attached to every finding. See the [hosted example report](https://0hardik1.github.io/kubesplaining/) for what the output actually looks like.

### Added

- **41 stable rule IDs across 7 analyzer modules.** Catalog with severity, detection logic, and remediation lives in [`docs/findings.md`](docs/findings.md). Rule IDs are a public surface — they are stable across releases and referenced from `findings.json`, the SARIF output, and the e2e assertions in `scripts/kind-e2e.sh`.
  - **rbac** (10) — wildcards, impersonate, bind/escalate, secret reads, pod create, nodes/proxy, token create, overbroad cluster-admin bindings.
  - **podsec** (13) — privileged containers, host namespaces (PID/network/IPC), hostPath mounts, container sockets, runAsRoot, mutable image tags, default-SA usage.
  - **network** (5) — namespaces missing NetworkPolicy, broad-internet egress, unselected workloads, unrestricted ingress.
  - **admission** (3) — webhooks with `failurePolicy: Ignore`, objectSelector bypass surface, sensitive-namespace exemptions.
  - **secrets** (4) — legacy SA token secrets, credential-like ConfigMap keys, CoreDNS tampering risk, kube-system Opaque secrets.
  - **serviceaccount** (4) — privileged SAs, default-SA RBAC, DaemonSet token blast-radius, workload-mounted SA risk correlation.
  - **privesc** (5 sinks) — multi-hop BFS to cluster-admin / system:masters / node-escape / kube-system-secrets / token-mint with chain-length severity attenuation.

- **Cluster-wide attack-path analysis.** `internal/analyzer/privesc/` builds a directed graph of RBAC subjects + sinks + pod-escape edges, BFS's from every non-`system:*` subject up to `--max-privesc-depth` (default 5), and emits one finding per (source, sink) pair with the full hop chain as `EscalationPath`.

- **Offline snapshot mode.** `kubesplaining download` captures a `snapshot.json` from a live cluster; `kubesplaining scan --input-file snapshot.json` analyzes it with no further cluster access. Useful for jumphost workflows, audits, and diffing cluster state over time.

- **`scan-resource` for ad-hoc manifest checks.** Run analyzers against a single YAML/JSON manifest without any cluster connection — handy for shift-left in `kubectl apply` review flows.

- **Four output formats.** HTML (self-contained, executive summary + per-module sections + attack graph + glossary), JSON (raw `[]Finding` for programmatic consumption), CSV (triage spreadsheets), SARIF (GitHub code scanning, IDE integration).

- **Composite scoring.** `score = base × exploitability × blast_radius + chain_modifier`, with the engine bumping non-privesc findings whose subject sits on a privesc chain. Cross-module dedupe on `(RuleID, Subject, Resource)` keeps the highest score and merges tags.

- **Exclusions presets.** `--exclusions-preset {standard|minimal|none}` filters built-in Kubernetes plumbing (kube-system / `system:*` / `kubeadm:*`) by default so actionable findings aren't buried under control-plane noise. Layer custom YAML rules with `--exclusions-file`.

- **CI mode.** `--ci-mode` with `--ci-max-critical` / `--ci-max-high` exits non-zero when the finding count exceeds the budget — pair with the SARIF output and `github/codeql-action/upload-sarif` to gate PRs.

- **Pre-built binaries and container image.** Linux/macOS amd64+arm64 and Windows amd64 archives on every release, plus a multi-arch image at `ghcr.io/0hardik1/kubesplaining:v1.0.0`.

### Documentation

- Comprehensive [README](README.md) with install paths, quickstart, comparison table vs. kube-bench / kubescape / KubiScan / rbac-tool.
- Full rule catalog and roadmap in [`docs/findings.md`](docs/findings.md) and [`PLAN.md`](PLAN.md).
- Live demo report at <https://0hardik1.github.io/kubesplaining/> regenerated on every push to `main`.

### Security

- Read-only access is sufficient for the full analysis. No admission webhook registration, no CRD install, no agent pods.
- Secrets are collected as `SecretMetadata` only — raw secret values are never read. ConfigMap data is redacted by the collector (keys preserved, values blanked) so analyzers can pattern-match credential-like key names without ever storing the payloads.
- Forbidden/Unauthorized list errors are downgraded to `CollectionWarnings` rather than aborting — locked-down clusters still produce a useful partial-snapshot report.
- Vulnerability disclosure: GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting only. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
