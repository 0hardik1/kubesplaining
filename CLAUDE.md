# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

Kubesplaining is a Go CLI for Kubernetes security assessment, modeled on Salesforce's Cloudsplaining. It reads cluster state (live or from a snapshot file) and emits scored findings as HTML, JSON, CSV, or SARIF.

`README.md` is the operator-facing overview. The comprehensive per-rule catalog (rule IDs, severity, detection logic, remediation, owning analyzer file) lives in [`docs/findings.md`](docs/findings.md) — read that first when adding or renaming a rule. The architectural deep-dive is in [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md), the exclusions YAML schema in [`docs/exclusions.md`](docs/exclusions.md). The implementation roadmap and current status of every spec item is in `PLAN.md`. The full functional spec is `KUBESPLAINING_SPEC.md`.

## Common commands

Developer tooling (Go, kubectl, kind, ripgrep) is pinned via [Hermit](https://cashapp.github.io/hermit/) under `bin/`. Either activate the environment once per shell with `. ./bin/activate-hermit`, or invoke binaries directly as `./bin/go ...`, `./bin/rg ...`, etc. The Hermit shims auto-download the pinned versions on first use into `~/Library/Caches/hermit`. Docker is not Hermit-managed.

All build/test commands route through the `Makefile`, which pins `GOCACHE` / `GOMODCACHE` under `.tmp/` so module downloads stay inside the repo.

```bash
make setup           # go mod download + create bin/ and .tmp/
make build           # builds ./bin/kubesplaining from ./cmd/kubesplaining
make test            # go test ./...
make lint            # gofmt -l check + go vet ./...
make e2e             # boots a kind cluster, applies testdata/e2e/vulnerable.yaml, runs the CLI, asserts expected rule IDs
make clean           # removes ./bin, ./kubesplaining-report, ./.tmp
make install-hooks   # activate .githooks/ pre-commit + commit-msg hooks (one-time per clone)
```

Commits follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) — the `commit-msg` hook enforces it once `make install-hooks` has run. The `pre-commit` hook runs `gofmt -l` and `golangci-lint` over the packages of staged `.go` files; install the linter once with `./bin/hermit install golangci-lint`. See `.githooks/README.md` for details and bypass.

**CI gates not exercised by `make lint`.** The `lint.yml` workflow runs three checks the Makefile does not. Hit each one locally before pushing or opening a PR:

- **`./bin/golangci-lint run ./...`** — repo-wide staticcheck/govet/etc. `make lint` only runs `gofmt -l` + `go vet`, so issues like `S1039` (unnecessary `fmt.Sprintf` without format args), unused returns, or staticcheck deprecations slip through `make lint` and fail in CI. The `pre-commit` hook covers this only when (a) hooks are installed and (b) the offending file is staged — neither is guaranteed.
- **PR title ≤ 72 chars** and matching the Conventional Commits regex in `.githooks/_conventional_commits_pattern.txt`. The check is in `.github/workflows/lint.yml` (`if [ "${#PR_TITLE}" -gt 72 ]`). Em-dashes count as one character. Use `gh pr edit <number> --title "..."` to fix an over-long title without amending commits.
- **`go vet` repo-wide** runs in its own job in addition to the one inside `make lint`; usually redundant, but means a packaging slip in one of them still trips.

Single-package or single-test runs (use the same `GOCACHE` / `GOMODCACHE` env so you do not redownload modules):

```bash
GOCACHE=$(pwd)/.tmp/go-build-cache GOMODCACHE=$(pwd)/.tmp/go-mod-cache \
  go test ./internal/analyzer/rbac/...

GOCACHE=$(pwd)/.tmp/go-build-cache GOMODCACHE=$(pwd)/.tmp/go-mod-cache \
  go test ./internal/analyzer/privesc -run TestFindPaths -v
```

`make e2e` requires a reachable Docker daemon (see `scripts/kind-e2e.sh`); `kind`, `kubectl`, `rg`, and `jq` come from Hermit once the environment is activated. It runs on every pull request via `.github/workflows/e2e.yml`, and again on merges to `main` inside `example-report.yml`, which publishes the resulting report to Pages. The script asserts findings six ways. The first four live under `testdata/e2e/expectations/`: (1) `*.expect` recall lists (each shard's owned rule IDs must fire); (2) `*.ruleset` **set-equality goldens** (`full-scan.ruleset` / `minimal-scan.ruleset` pin the exact rule-ID set each scan produces, so a new rule appearing (candidate false positive) or an expected one vanishing both fail); (3) `*.deny` instance-level negative guards (finding-ID prefixes that must be absent); (4) `*.chain` shape assertions: a finding-ID prefix, a minimum hop count, and an ordered subsequence of hop actions, matched against exactly one finding. An optional fourth column, `primary` (the default when omitted) or `alternate`, selects `escalation_path` or `alternate_escalation_path`; alternate assertions are the only gate that covers cut-resilience, since the ruleset goldens stay identical by design when a route merely survives a remediation cut. The remaining two are not fixture files. (5) A universal invariant gate walks every finding in the full-scan output carrying a non-empty `alternate_escalation_path` and fails if its first hop names the same binding the recommended fix cuts, printing how many findings it checked so a fixture regression that leaves zero alternates cannot pass silently. (6) A `--remediation-patches` rescan (`.tmp/e2e-report-remediation`; hints are stripped from the default scan) requires at least one `KUBE-CONFUSED-DEPUTY-001` finding whose `remediation_hint.patch.target` names a real (Cluster)RoleBinding, since a bare non-null hint check would still pass if every deputy finding regressed to the generic advisory fallback with no `patch` object. When you add or rename a rule the fixture produces, update the `*.expect` list **and regenerate the golden** (`LC_ALL=C jq -r '.[].rule_id' .tmp/e2e-report-full/findings.json | LC_ALL=C sort -u > testdata/e2e/expectations/full-scan.ruleset`, and the same for `-minimal`), alongside the `testdata/e2e/vulnerable/` shard. The deterministic, Docker-free precision/recall counterpart is `make corpus` (see `internal/corpus/` + `testdata/corpus/`).

`gofmt -l` is the lint gate; the Makefile lists Go files via `rg --files -g '*.go'` (Hermit-managed).

## Architecture

Four-stage pipeline: **connection → collection → analysis → report**. The boundary that matters most: the **collector is the only thing that talks to the Kubernetes API**; analyzers consume `models.Snapshot` and never make network calls. This is what enables `download` → `scan --input-file` for offline analysis.

```

    └── internal/collector/           # parallel API listing → models.Snapshot (single ~657-line collector.go)

    └── internal/models/              # Snapshot, Finding, Severity, EscalationGraph/Path/Hop — the cross-package vocabulary
```

### The analyzer engine (`internal/analyzer/engine.go`)

Every analyzer module implements:

```go
type Module interface {
    Name() string
    Analyze(ctx context.Context, snapshot models.Snapshot) ([]models.Finding, error)
}
```

`Engine.Analyze` runs all selected modules **in parallel goroutines**, then post-processes:

1. `correlate` — bumps the score of any non-privesc finding whose `Subject` appears as the source of a privesc path, tagging it `chain:amplified` (see `analyzer/correlate.go` and `scoring.ChainModifier`).
2. `dedupe` — collapses cross-module duplicates keyed by `(RuleID, SubjectKey, ResourceKey)`, keeping the highest score and merging `Tags`. Exception: a finding carrying a non-empty `EscalationPath` (only `privesc` populates one) keys on its own `Finding.ID` instead, since a chain is identified by its endpoints: two chains from one subject to different sinks are different findings, not duplicates.
3. Threshold filter via `scoring.AboveThreshold`.
4. Stable sort by severity rank → score → rule ID → title.

The modules live under `internal/analyzer/{rbac,podsec,network,admission,secrets,serviceaccount,privesc,certificates,containersec,leastprivilege,cel,cloud}`. The canonical, ordered list is `DefaultModules` in `internal/analyzer/modules.go` — adding an analyzer means creating the package and appending one factory entry there, not editing `NewWithConfig`. The `--only-modules` / `--skip-modules` flags select against `Module.Name()`.

Note the split between `rbac` and `certificates` for the certificates API: `rbac` owns the *permission* rules (`KUBE-PRIVESC-011` approval path, `-024` signing path — who could mint a client certificate), `certificates` owns the *evidence* rules (`KUBE-CSR-001` / `-002` — who actually requested one). Neither infers the other, and the collector deliberately drops the raw CSR PEM, so no rule may claim to know which identity a CSR's Subject DN asked for.

### `privesc` is the differentiator

`internal/analyzer/privesc/` builds a directed graph (`graph.go`) where nodes are RBAC subjects plus seven sink targets (`cluster_admin`, `kube_system_secrets`, `namespace_admin`, `node_escape`, `system_masters`, `token_mint`, `aws_iam_role`); the first six are built in `graph.go`, `aws_iam_role` is built separately in `cloud_edges.go` from IRSA, aws-auth, and EKS access-entry data (the last only when `scan --eks-access-entries` loaded an export into `Snapshot.Cloud.EKS`). Edges are RBAC techniques (impersonate, bind/escalate, pod-create-then-token-theft, token mint, etc.). `pathfinder.go` BFS's from every non-`system:*` subject up to `MaxDepth` (default 5, flag: `--max-privesc-depth`), and `analyzer.go` emits one finding per `(source, sink)` pair with the full hop chain as `EscalationPath`. A second pass then re-runs the search per source with the binding that granted hop 1 banned, scoped to edges leaving that subject; a route that still reaches the sink becomes `AlternateEscalationPath` plus the tag `privesc:survives-first-cut`, so a finding can state whether its own recommended fix actually closes the route. Severity is attenuated by summed per-hop difficulty cost (`easy` 0.15, `moderate` 0.4, `hard` 0.9): `score = base − Σ cost` (clamped to `[1, 10]`), and a chain drops one severity bucket when it contains at least one `hard` hop, regardless of hop count. Edges carry `Needs` / `Grants` footholds (`models.Foothold`: `FootholdIdentity` acting as the SA via the API, `FootholdToken` holding a presentable token for it (a strict credential, implies identity), `FootholdPod` a shell in its existing pods, `FootholdNewPod` a pod the attacker created as it), zero meaning identity; BFS walks an edge only when the attacker holds one foothold it needs and tracks the foothold set per node, so `pod_host_escape` cannot follow `token_request` / impersonation / `pod_create_token_theft`; exec into a pod that mounts no API token (the automount check in `serviceAccountsWithAPIToken`) yields the pod but not the SA's RBAC; and `irsa_assume_role` needs token-or-pod, so impersonation and `operator_reconcile` (bare identity) do not reach an IRSA role. Set both fields on any new edge that enters or leaves a pod rather than an identity. Exec/ephemeral edges honor `resourceNames` via `execTargets`. Subjects flagged `IsSystem` (built-in `system:*`) are skipped as intermediate hops (they're only valid as terminal sinks via explicit edges), so paths can't launder through the control plane.

### Data flow contract

- `models.Snapshot` is plain JSON-serializable. `collector.WriteSnapshot` / `collector.ReadSnapshot` round-trip it. The `download` command writes one; `scan --input-file` and the e2e script consume one.
- Secrets are collected as `SecretMetadata` only: **raw secret values are never read**. ConfigMaps go through `redactConfigMapValues` in the collector: **keys are preserved, values are blanked to empty strings** so analyzers can pattern-match credential-like key names without ever storing the payloads. Two well-known kube-system ConfigMaps are carve-outs and stored verbatim: `kube-system/aws-auth` (the EKS IAM-to-RBAC mapping is needed by the `cloud/eks` aws-auth analyzer to name the offending IAM principals) and `kube-system/coredns` (the Corefile is substring-matched by `KUBE-CONFIGMAP-002` to detect risky rewrite / forward directives). Both exceptions are pinned to the `configMapAWSAuth` / `configMapCoreDNS` constants at the top of `internal/collector/collector.go`. Do not change this without re-reading the privacy notes in `README.md`.
- Forbidden/Unauthorized list errors in the collector are **downgraded to warnings** and recorded in `Snapshot.Metadata.CollectionWarnings` / `PermissionsMissing`. Don't promote these to fatal — locked-down clusters depend on partial-snapshot behavior.
- `permissions.Aggregate(snapshot)` is the canonical way to get effective RBAC per subject; the `rbac` and `serviceaccount` analyzers both use it. Don't re-traverse bindings/roles ad hoc.

### Scoring

`internal/scoring/scorer.go` defines the composite formula:

```
score = base × exploitability × blast_radius + chain_modifier
```

`Compose(Factors{...})` clamps to `[0, 10]`. Most analyzers currently emit a hand-picked `Score` directly; the engine's correlation pass adds `ChainModifier` post-hoc. When adding a new rule, prefer populating the factor inputs over a fixed score so cross-module ordering stays meaningful.

### Findings

Every analyzer emits `models.Finding` with a stable `RuleID`. Rule IDs are referenced from [`docs/findings.md`](docs/findings.md), the e2e assertions in `scripts/kind-e2e.sh`, and likely downstream consumers — treat them as a public surface. The naming convention is `KUBE-<AREA>-<SUFFIX>`, where the suffix is either a zero-padded number (`KUBE-ESCAPE-001`) or, for privesc graph paths, a descriptive sink name (`KUBE-PRIVESC-PATH-CLUSTER-ADMIN`). Multi-segment areas are common when a module covers several axes — e.g. `KUBE-PODSEC-APE-001`, `KUBE-PODSEC-ROOT-001`, `KUBE-NETPOL-COVERAGE-001`, `KUBE-NETPOL-WEAKNESS-001`, `KUBE-SA-DEFAULT-001`, `KUBE-SA-PRIVILEGED-001`. Other prefixes in use today: `KUBE-PRIVESC-`, `KUBE-ESCAPE-`, `KUBE-CONTAINERD-SOCKET-`, `KUBE-HOSTPATH-`, `KUBE-IMAGE-LATEST-`, `KUBE-ADMISSION-`, `KUBE-SECRETS-`, `KUBE-CONFIGMAP-`, `KUBE-RBAC-OVERBROAD-`. See [`docs/findings.md`](docs/findings.md) for the authoritative list.

`Finding.ID` is the deterministic per-instance key (`RULE:ns:name`); `RuleID` is shared across instances of the same rule. Exclusions are evaluated *after* analysis: `exclusions.Apply` drops matched findings from the output slice (the matcher sets `Excluded=true` + `ExclusionReason` on the in-memory copy first, but the field isn't surfaced to the report writer because the finding is gone). The `standard` preset is auto-applied; pass `--exclusions-preset=none` to opt out. See [`docs/exclusions.md`](docs/exclusions.md) for the YAML schema.

### Report-layer educational content (`internal/report/glossary.go`)

Three maps carry presentation-only copy that deliberately does **not** live on `models.Finding`, so JSON/CSV/SARIF outputs stay clean and copy can iterate without re-running scans:

- `Glossary[Kind]` — definitions of subject/resource Kinds (`ServiceAccount`, `Pod`, `Secret`, `Deployment`, ...) with `Title` / `Short` / `Long` / `DocURL`.
- `Techniques[ActionSlug]` — attacker-technique explainers keyed by chain-hop `Action` (`impersonate`, `read_secrets`, `pod_host_escape`, ...) with `Title` / `Plain` / `Mitre` / `AttackerSteps`.
- `Categories[CategoryName]` — impact-lane copy for the Attack Graph (`privilege_escalation`, `lateral_movement`, ...).

`GlossaryKeyForSubject` / `GlossaryKeyForResource` / `TechniqueKeyForFinding` (all in `glossary.go`) resolve a `Finding` to keys. Both the interactive Attack Graph (`attack_graph.go` → `GraphPayload`) and the static Findings tab (`education_render.go` → `findingEducationHTML`) consume them.

The static **"How an attacker abuses this"** section is one combined `.scenario` wrapper that holds, in order: a `Background` block of glossary cards (Subject / Resource / Technique definitions), the `AttackScenario` narrative (`<ol class="attack-narrative">`), and the `EscalationPath` chain cards (`<ol class="attack-chain">`). The Background block suppresses its Technique entry when the chain renders technique copy per-hop, to avoid duplication. There is no separate "Observed attack chain" section anymore.

When you add a rule that targets a new resource/subject Kind, or a new privesc Action slug, also add the corresponding `Glossary` / `Techniques` entry — otherwise the Background block silently drops that aspect.

## Conventions worth preserving

- Package doc comments at the top of each `package foo` file describe the package's role; new files should follow the same pattern.
- Cobra subcommands live one-per-file in `internal/cli/` and are wired from `root.go`.
- Test files sit alongside the code (`foo.go` ↔ `foo_test.go`); table-driven tests are the norm.
- `testdata/snapshots/minimal-risky.json` and `testdata/manifests/risky-resource.yaml` are reusable fixtures; reach for them before fabricating new ones.

## Module/dependency notes

Module path is `github.com/0hardik1/kubesplaining` and `go.mod` requires Go 1.26. Core deps: `spf13/cobra` for the CLI, `k8s.io/{api,apimachinery,client-go}` v0.36.x for cluster types and access. There is no separate `go-yaml` direct dep — `gopkg.in/yaml.v3` is used for the exclusions file loader.
