# Architecture

How Kubesplaining is wired internally. For *what* it does (rule library, install, usage), see the [README](../README.md). For the implementation roadmap, see [PLAN.md](../PLAN.md).

## The four-stage pipeline

```

The boundary that matters most: the **collector is the only thing that talks to the Kubernetes API**; analyzers consume `models.Snapshot` and never make network calls. That separation is what makes `download` → `scan --input-file` work for offline analysis.

## Stage 1 — Connection ([internal/connection/](../internal/connection/))

Resolves credentials in the standard client-go order: `--kubeconfig` flag → `KUBECONFIG` env → `~/.kube/config` → in-cluster service account. Also accepts direct `--api-server` + `--token` for audit scenarios. **Read-only access is sufficient** for the full analysis; no admission webhook registration, no CRD install, no pod creation.

## Stage 2 — Collection ([internal/collector/collector.go](../internal/collector/collector.go))

In parallel (capped by `--parallelism`), lists every supported resource kind and dumps them into a `models.Snapshot`:

- **RBAC** — Roles, ClusterRoles, RoleBindings, ClusterRoleBindings.
- **Workloads** — Pods, Deployments, DaemonSets, StatefulSets, Jobs, CronJobs.
- **Networking** — NetworkPolicies, Services, Ingresses.
- **Admission** — ValidatingWebhookConfigurations, MutatingWebhookConfigurations.
- **Identity** — ServiceAccounts, Secrets (metadata only — raw values are never read), ConfigMaps.
- **Platform** — Nodes, Namespaces.

Forbidden / Unauthorized errors are **downgraded to warnings**, not fatal — a partial snapshot still produces useful output. This matters in locked-down clusters where the scanning credential cannot list everything.

The snapshot is a plain JSON file. `kubesplaining download` writes it; `kubesplaining scan --input-file` consumes it. This separation means you can capture a snapshot on a jumphost and analyze it offline, or diff snapshots over time.

## Stage 3 — Analysis ([internal/analyzer/engine.go](../internal/analyzer/engine.go))

The engine runs seven modules **in parallel** against the snapshot. Each module implements the same interface:

```go
type Module interface {
    Name() string
    Analyze(ctx context.Context, snapshot models.Snapshot) ([]models.Finding, error)
}
```

The modules:

1. **rbac** — effective-permission aggregation via [`internal/permissions/`](../internal/permissions/), then pattern-matches against the technique database.
2. **podsec** — per-container / per-pod-template security context inspection.
3. **network** — NetworkPolicy coverage and weakness detection.
4. **admission** — webhook inventory, failurePolicy, bypass surface.
5. **secrets** — long-lived SA tokens, credential-like ConfigMap keys, CoreDNS tampering.
6. **serviceaccount** — default-SA risk, workload-mounted SA blast radius, DaemonSet amplification.
7. **privesc** — **the differentiator.** Builds a directed graph where nodes are RBAC subjects and sinks like `cluster-admin`, `node-escape`, `kube-system-secrets`, `system:masters`. Edges are labeled with the technique that enables the hop. Runs BFS from every non-system subject (capped at `--max-privesc-depth`, default 5) and emits one finding per `(source, sink)` pair with the full hop-by-hop chain attached.

After modules return, the engine post-processes the combined findings list:

1. **Correlate** — bumps the score of any non-privesc finding whose `Subject` appears as the source of a privesc path, tagging it `chain:amplified` (see [`analyzer/correlate.go`](../internal/analyzer/correlate.go) and `scoring.ChainModifier`).
2. **Dedupe** — collapses cross-module duplicates keyed by `(RuleID, SubjectKey, ResourceKey)`, keeping the highest score and merging tags.
3. **Threshold filter** via `scoring.AboveThreshold` (`--severity-threshold`).
4. **Stable sort** by severity rank → score → rule ID → title.

## Stage 4 — Report ([internal/report/](../internal/report/))

The same finding list is serialized into:

- **HTML** — self-contained (CSS/JS inlined via Go's `embed`), executive summary, per-module sections, severity counts, category breakdown, per-finding educational copy.
- **JSON** — the raw `[]Finding` for programmatic consumption.
- **CSV** — triage-friendly, one row per finding.
- **SARIF** — for GitHub code scanning / IDE integration.

Educational copy in the HTML report (Glossary entries, Technique explainers, Category copy) is presentation-only and lives in [`internal/report/glossary.go`](../internal/report/glossary.go) — it is deliberately not on `models.Finding`, so JSON / CSV / SARIF stay clean and copy can iterate without re-running scans.

## Data Model ([internal/models/](../internal/models/))

- **`Snapshot`** — the cluster dump.
- **`Finding`** — the unit every analyzer emits. Carries `ID`, `RuleID`, Severity (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW/INFO), Score (0–10), Category, Subject/Resource references, Evidence (JSON blob), Remediation, References, Tags, and optionally an `EscalationPath`.
- **`SubjectRef`** / **`ResourceRef`** — canonical `Kind/[Namespace/]Name` identifiers.
- **`EscalationGraph`** / **`EscalationNode`** / **`EscalationEdge`** / **`EscalationPath`** / **`EscalationHop`** — the graph types consumed by the privesc module.

`Finding.ID` is a deterministic per-instance key (`RULE:ns:name`); `RuleID` is shared across instances of the same rule and is treated as a public surface — stable across releases, referenced from `findings.json`, the SARIF output, and the e2e assertions in `scripts/kind-e2e.sh`.

## Scoring ([internal/scoring/scorer.go](../internal/scoring/scorer.go))

The composite formula is:

```
score = base × exploitability × blast_radius + chain_modifier
```

`Compose(Factors{...})` clamps to `[0, 10]`. Where:

- `exploitability` is higher when the subject is a ServiceAccount *actually mounted by a pod* (the SA's credential is sitting on disk somewhere the attacker can already reach).
- `blast_radius` is higher for cluster-scoped rules and for subjects in `kube-system` or on a DaemonSet (token replicated to every node).
- `chain_modifier` comes from the privesc module's hop count — longer chains reduce severity (`base − 0.5 × (hops − 1)`, hops ≥ 3 drop one severity bucket).

Most analyzers currently emit a hand-picked `Score` directly; the engine's correlation pass adds `ChainModifier` post-hoc. New rules should prefer populating the factor inputs over a fixed score so cross-module ordering stays meaningful.

## Access requirements

Kubesplaining needs **cluster-wide read** on the resource kinds listed under Stage 2. A suitable ClusterRole is a subset of the built-in `view` role plus `get`/`list` on RBAC objects and webhook configurations. Forbidden listings are recorded as `missing_permissions` warnings in the snapshot and do not abort the run; the affected modules just operate on a partial view.

No admission webhooks, CRDs, or agent pods are installed. The tool is safe to point at production.

## Exclusions ([internal/exclusions/](../internal/exclusions/))

Exclusions are applied **after** analysis — they annotate `Finding.Excluded = true` rather than dropping the finding. The report writer hides excluded findings from the summary tally but keeps them available in the raw JSON output, so audit trails are preserved. The YAML schema (Global / RBAC / PodSecurity / NetworkPolicy sections, all matchers support shell-style globs) is documented inline in `internal/exclusions/loader.go`.
