# Privilege-Escalation Methodology Gap Research

Research reference cataloguing Kubernetes privilege-escalation methodologies that
**kubesplaining does not model today** — new RBAC/API primitives, confused-deputy
paths through privileged controllers, admission-layer abuse, MITM vectors, node/PKI
escapes, storage escapes, multi-cloud identity, and long multi-hop chains the
current BFS cannot surface. It also proposes how each maps onto the existing
`privesc` graph (`internal/analyzer/privesc/`): the new sinks, edge types, and rule
IDs that would let the tool detect them.

This is a **planning/roadmap document**, not shipped detection. Nothing here is
emitted by the analyzer yet. See [`findings.md`](findings.md) for what *is*
implemented and [`PLAN.md`](../PLAN.md) for status.

## How this was produced

A multi-agent research sweep (12 technique families → per-technique adversarial
verification → long-chain design → novel-vector plausibility voting → completeness
critic) surfaced 84 candidate techniques; 57 verified as genuine gaps and 21 as
partial-coverage, plus 20 long chains and 15 novel vectors that survived a 2-of-3
plausibility vote. This document is the deduplicated, code-cross-referenced
synthesis. Every mechanism was checked against `graph.go` / `cloud_edges.go` /
`snapshot.go` to confirm it is actually unmodeled, and against Kubernetes docs /
CVEs for technical correctness.

## How to read this — detectability tiers

A "detectable" gap must be inferable from a `models.Snapshot` **offline** (RBAC via
`permissions.Aggregate` + collected object specs; no live API). Each entry is tagged:

| Tier | Meaning | Implementable today? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **A** | Fires on data the collector **already** captures (RBAC grants, Pod/controller specs, Nodes, existing webhook configs, SecretMetadata, ConfigMap keys). | Yes — rule + graph edge only. |
| **B** | Needs a **new object type** added to the snapshot (Services, Endpoints/EndpointSlices, Ingresses, APIServices, CSIDrivers, VAP/bindings, PriorityClasses, operator CRs, CSRs). Node runtime/kernel version strings are *already present* but unparsed. | Yes — collector extension + rule. |
| **C** | Precondition lives **outside the cluster** (cloud IAM policies, apiserver `--client-ca-file` trust, feature-gate state). Detection is **origin-only**: name the pivot, flag intent, cannot confirm the completed edge. | Partial — same fidelity as the shipped EKS IRSA edge. |

## Baseline recap — what is already modeled

So gaps are unambiguous. The `privesc` graph has **7 sinks** — `cluster_admin`,
`system_masters`, `node_escape`, `kube_system_secrets`, `token_mint`, per-namespace
`namespace_admin`, external `aws_iam_role` — and edges from `KUBE-PRIVESC-001…017`
(pod-create/exec/ephemeral/portforward, secrets read/mint, impersonate, bind/escalate,
rolebinding-write, CSR+approval, nodes/proxy, token-request, node-drain, wildcard),
the pod-escape edges (privileged/hostPID/hostNet/hostIPC/sensitive-hostPath/dangerous-caps/
procMount/APE/PV-hostPath), and the EKS cloud edges (IRSA, aws-auth, IMDS-pivot). System
subjects are skipped as intermediate hops. **Everything below is outside that set.**

---

## A. Structural gaps in the graph model (highest leverage)

These are not individual rules — they are shape limits in `BuildGraph` / `FindPaths`
that make whole *classes* of chain invisible. Fixing them unlocks many Section K chains
at once.

### A1. `namespace_admin` is a dead-end sink, never chained onward
`ensureNamespaceAdminSink` sets `IsSink: true`, and `FindPaths` halts on any sink. So a
subject that reaches `namespace_admin:X` is never expanded further — even though namespace
admin over `X` implies **stealing any ServiceAccount token living in `X`** (create a pod as
that SA, exec into its pods, or read its token Secret). If `X` hosts a controller/operator SA
that is `ClusterRoleBinding`-bound to a powerful role (or `X` is `kube-system`), that two-hop
correlation reaches `cluster_admin`/`system_masters` and is currently silent.
**Fix:** make `namespace_admin:X` a *traversable intermediate* with `colocated_sa_token_theft`
edges to every SA whose namespace is `X`; let BFS continue from those SA nodes. (`kube-system`
is the extreme case: bootstrap-token Secrets + every control-plane SA.)

### A2. `node_escape` is terminal — no "and then" from node root
`addPodEscapeEdges` / `KUBE-PRIVESC-002/012/016` all terminate at `node_escape`, which has no
outbound edges. But node root on a **control-plane** node yields `/etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.key`
and `sa.key` (→ offline `system:masters` cert forgery and arbitrary SA-token forgery), and
writable `/etc/kubernetes/manifests` runs static/mirror pods bypassing *all* admission.
**Fix:** make `node_escape` a conditional intermediate with onward edges to `system_masters`
(control-plane PKI theft) and `token_mint` (SA signing-key theft), gated on a control-plane-node
heuristic (`node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane` label/taint).

### A3. No confused-deputy edge type (CRD-write → privileged reconciler SA)
`addEdgesForRule` only maps built-in RBAC verbs. A grant of `create`/`patch` on an operator
CRD (`kustomizations.kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io`, `applications.argoproj.io`,
`workflows.argoproj.io`, `certificates.cert-manager.io`, `externalsecrets.external-secrets.io`,
`restores.velero.io`, Kyverno policies, Crossplane compositions, …) maps to **no sink**, even
though the reconciling controller SA is frequently `cluster-admin`. This is the single largest
missing edge *family* (Section C). **Fix:** a catalog-driven `operator_reconcile` bridge edge
`subject → controllerSA(K)`, gated on `permissions.Aggregate(controllerSA)` already reaching a
sink and on the CR spec being attacker-steerable.

### A4. No traffic-intercept / MITM sink
The graph has no sink for man-in-the-middle. Multiple *unpatched-by-design* primitives —
Service `externalIPs` (CVE-2020-8554), Endpoints/EndpointSlice repoint, CoreDNS Corefile
rewrite, malicious aggregated `APIService`, admission-webhook payload exfil — all yield
credential/token capture but have nowhere to terminate. **Fix:** add
`TargetTrafficIntercept` (lateral-movement lane) with soft onward edges to
`kube_system_secrets` / `token_mint` when a token-bearing flow is the intercept target.

### A5. Cloud edges are EKS-only and IAM nodes are terminal
`models.CloudIdentity` only defines AWS kinds; `cloud_edges.go` documents GKE/AKS as
"reserved". And the external `aws-iam` node has **no outbound edges** — so no chain crosses
back *into* the cluster (IAM → `eks:AssociateAccessPolicy` / GKE `roles/container.admin` /
AKS `listClusterAdminCredential` → cluster-admin). **Fix:** `TargetGCPServiceAccount` /
`TargetAzureManagedIdentity` sinks mirroring IRSA; and a **cloud-return edge table** so a
cloud-admin IAM node re-enters the cluster graph (Section J, chains C17–C20).

### A6. Impersonation ignores `resourceName` and non-core subresources
`KUBE-PRIVESC-008` maps `impersonate groups → system_masters` and `impersonate users →
cluster_admin` *generically*. It therefore both (a) mis-sinks `impersonate system:nodes` as
`system_masters` (a node identity is **not** cluster-admin — it's the Node authorizer's
per-node scope), and (b) never matches `impersonate` on `authentication.k8s.io/uids` or
`userextras/*` (authz-attribute spoofing). **Fix:** `resourceName`-aware impersonation with a
distinct `TargetNodeIdentity` sink and a conditional `authz_attribute_spoof` edge.

## B. New RBAC / API privesc primitives

Direct subject→sink edges keyed on an RBAC triple the graph does not match today. Unless noted,
these are **Tier A** (fire on current snapshot data).

| Proposed rule | Sev | RBAC signal (verb · resource · apiGroup) | Terminal gain / sink | Tier |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| KUBE-PRIVESC-018 | CRITICAL | create/update/patch · `mutatingwebhookconfigurations` / `validatingwebhookconfigurations` · admissionregistration.k8s.io | Mutating → `cluster_admin` (+`node_escape` via injected privileged sidecar); Validating → `kube_system_secrets` (AdmissionReview exfil). *See §D1.* | A |

| KUBE-PRIVESC-020 | CRITICAL | create/update/patch · `apiservices` · apiregistration.k8s.io | Register aggregated API server → control-plane MITM/credential-forward (CVE-2022-3172) → `traffic_intercept`/`cluster_admin`. | A (edge) / B (flag existing) |
| KUBE-PRIVESC-021 | HIGH | create/update/patch · `endpoints` (core) / `endpointslices` (discovery.k8s.io) | Repoint a Service backend (esp. a webhook/aggregated-API backing Service) → `traffic_intercept`. CVE-2021-25737/25740. | A (grant) / B (target scoping) |
| KUBE-PRIVESC-022 | HIGH | create/update · `services` (core); update/patch · `services/status` | Set `spec.externalIPs` / `status.loadBalancer.ingress` → kube-proxy MITM of arbitrary IPs incl. IMDS/apiserver (CVE-2020-8554, unpatched-by-design) → `traffic_intercept`. | A (grant) / B (suppress if externalip-webhook present) |
| KUBE-PRIVESC-023 | MEDIUM | update/patch · `leases` · coordination.k8s.io (esp. `resourceNames` kube-controller-manager/-scheduler) | Overwrite `holderIdentity` → controller reconciliation DoS; conditional leader takeover only if attacker runs a matching replica. Weak `controller_hijack` sink. | A |
| KUBE-PRIVESC-024 | CRITICAL | `sign` / `approve` · `signers` · certificates.k8s.io (`resourceName kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client`) | Sign an arbitrary client cert `O=system:masters` directly, bypassing the approval controller — distinct from `-011`'s create+`/approval`. → `system_masters`. | A |
| KUBE-PRIVESC-025 | HIGH* | impersonate · `uids` / `userextras/*` · authentication.k8s.io | Forge `Impersonate-Uid`/`-Extra-*` → spoof authorizing attributes. *Conditional:* only escalates when a webhook/ABAC/authenticating-proxy authorizer keys on extras/uid (worthless on stock RBAC-only). → conditional `cluster_admin`. | A (grant) / C (impact) |
| KUBE-PRIVESC-026 | HIGH | create · `secrets` type `bootstrap.kubernetes.io/token` in kube-system (+ standing `system:node-bootstrapper` / nodeclient auto-approver bindings) | Mint a bootstrap token → `system:bootstrappers` → auto-approved nodeclient CSR → `system:node:<name>` identity. New `TargetNodeIdentity` sink (node-scoped, not cluster-admin). | A (all three signals in snapshot) |
| KUBE-PRIVESC-027 | CRITICAL | create · `persistentvolumes` (core, cluster) + create · `persistentvolumeclaims` + create · `pods`/controllers | Attacker-minted hostPath PV; PSA **cannot** follow PVC→PV → privileged host mount even in a Restricted namespace → `node_escape`. Distinct from `KUBE-PV-HOSTPATH-001` (which flags *existing* PVs). | A |
| KUBE-PRIVESC-028 | HIGH | create · `storageclasses` · storage.k8s.io | Steer a hostPath-capable dynamic provisioner (`pathPattern` traversal, local-path-provisioner CVE-2025-62878) → `node_escape`. PVC-time StorageClass ref is **not** permission-checked. | A (grant) / B (provisioner image + version) |
| KUBE-PRIVESC-029 | HIGH | get · `nodes/log` / `nodes/configz` / `nodes/stats` / `nodes/spec` (core) | Fine-grained kubelet subresources (GA 1.36), separate from `nodes/proxy`. `nodes/log` historically path-traverses to node files (tokens, `*.conf`, PKI). → `node_escape`/node cred disclosure. | A |
| KUBE-PRIVESC-030 | HIGH | create · `pods/binding` (core) + create · `pods` | Act as scheduler: write `spec.nodeName` directly, bypassing taints/affinity/gates → co-reside on a control-plane node → hostPath PKI → `system_masters`. | A (grant) / C (hostPath+control-plane join) |
| KUBE-PRIVESC-031 | HIGH | create · `pods`/controllers (any namespace with a valued Secret) | Mount **any** Secret in the namespace as `volumes[].secret` / `envFrom.secretRef` and read it at runtime — no `get/list secrets` verb needed. Canonical, unmodeled. → named `kube_system_secrets`/`token_mint`. | A |
| KUBE-PRIVESC-032 | CRITICAL | update/patch · existing privileged kube-system DaemonSet (kube-proxy, CNI, csi-node) | Higher blast-radius special case of `-003`: edit an *already* hostPath/hostNetwork DaemonSet image/command → attacker code on **every** node at once → cluster-wide `node_escape`. | A |
| KUBE-PRIVESC-033 | MEDIUM | create/update · `priorityclasses` (scheduling.k8s.io); create · `pods/eviction`; patch · `nodes` labels/taints | Scheduling-layer steering: `globalDefault` flip / preemption storm; evict a webhook backend to open a fail-open window; relabel a node to attract a privileged DaemonSet onto attacker hardware. Lateral → `token_mint`/`kube_system_secrets`. *Novel N12–N14.* | A (grant) / B (PriorityClass/PDB collection) |

\*Severity conditional on authorizer configuration.

---

## C. Confused-deputy via privileged controllers & operators

The most impactful missing *family* (structural gap A3). A subject with only
`create`/`patch` on an operator's CRD escalates **through** that operator's
high-privilege ServiceAccount. All are **Tier B** on the "which controller watches
which CRD" mapping (a shipped catalog constant), but the two halves are individually
snapshot-visible: the CRD-write grant (`permissions.Aggregate`) and the controller SA
reaching a sink (already computed for `KUBE-RBAC-OVERBROAD-001`).

Proposed prefix: **`KUBE-CONFUSED-DEPUTY-*`**, plus a generic meta-edge
`KUBE-CONFUSED-DEPUTY-001`.

| Operator | Attacker CRD-write grant | Deputy SA power abused | Gain | Notes / CVE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Flux** | create/patch `kustomizations` / `helmreleases` (kustomize/helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io) | kustomize/helm-controller (cluster-admin by default) applies attacker-authored manifests incl. a `ClusterRoleBinding` | `cluster_admin` | Works on patched Flux; `--default-service-account` is the only mitigation. GHSA-35rf-v2jv-gfg7. |
| **Argo CD** | create/patch `applications` / `appprojects` (argoproj.io), or app-in-any-namespace via `sourceNamespaces` | argocd-application-controller (cluster-admin) syncs privileged manifests | `cluster_admin` | Not CVE-dependent; CVE-2023-22736 is the enforcement-bypass widener. |
| **Argo Workflows / Tekton** | create `workflows`/`cronworkflows` (argoproj.io) / `pipelineruns`/`taskruns` (tekton.dev) | Controller builds executor pod as **attacker-named `spec.serviceAccountName`** — no `pods` verb needed | namespace-admin (any SA in ns) | Distinct from `KUBE-PRIVESC-001`: subject never holds `create pods`. Model as edge → every SA node in ns. |
| **cert-manager** | create `certificates` / `certificaterequests` (cert-manager.io) referencing a CA `ClusterIssuer` | certificate-controller holds the CA key; auto-approves in-tree issuer requests | `system_masters` (if CA is apiserver `--client-ca-file`) | Needs no CSR `/approval` half (contrast `-011`). Tier C on the apiserver-trust condition. |
| **external-secrets** | create `externalsecrets` / `clusterexternalsecrets` (external-secrets.io) → `ClusterSecretStore` | ESO controller's cloud creds fetch backend secrets into the attacker's namespace; `rbac.serviceAccountTokenCreate` mints SA tokens | cloud secret exfil; `token_mint` | ClusterSecretStore is the lever (referenceable cross-namespace). |
| **Kyverno** | create namespaced `policies` / `policyexceptions` (kyverno.io) with `apiCall`/`generate` | Policy `apiCall` runs as the Kyverno controller SA, unscoped | `cluster_admin` | GHSA-8p9x-46gm-qfx2; CVE-2024-48921 (PolicyException in any ns). |
| **Velero** | create `restores` (velero.io) / edit `backups` | velero server SA (cluster-admin) recreates arbitrary RBAC/workloads | `cluster_admin` | Requires influence over backup content. |
| **Crossplane / Cluster-API** | create/patch `Composition`/`Object`/managed-resource / `Machine` CRs | provider-controller holds cloud creds; reconciles into IAM roles, RoleBindings, infra | `cluster_admin` / cloud IAM | *Critic add.* Cloud-grade blast radius. |
| **OLM** | create `Subscription` / `OperatorGroup` | Installs an operator with attacker-chosen RBAC via the CSV | `cluster_admin` | *Critic add.* |
| **KubeVirt** | create `virtualmachines` / `virtualmachineinstances` (kubevirt.io) | virt-controller materializes a privileged virt-launcher pod, bypassing the requester's PSS | `node_escape` | *Novel N8.* Deputy-created pod escapes requester PodSecurity. |
| **Karpenter / autoscaler** | create/patch `ec2nodeclasses`/`nodepools`/`nodeclaims` | Provisions a node with attacker `userData` / AMI / instanceProfile | attacker node → SA-token harvest + cloud IAM | *Novel N9.* |
| **GitOps generic** (`KUBE-CONFUSED-DEPUTY-001`) | create/patch a catalogued CRD whose spec is attacker-steerable | any controller SA that already reaches a sink | that SA's sink | Meta-edge; tag each catalog entry with whether the CR spec actually *directs* the privileged action. |

---

## D. Admission-control abuse as a privesc primitive

kubesplaining audits *existing* weak webhooks (`KUBE-ADMISSION-001/003`) but never
models the **ability to create/patch** admission machinery as an edge. All Tier A on
the RBAC grant.

- **D1 · Create a webhook configuration (`KUBE-PRIVESC-018`).** `create` on
  `mutatingwebhookconfigurations` registers a cluster-wide tap on the API write path
  (after authn/authz, before persistence). A **mutating** webhook matching `pods CREATE`
  injects `privileged`/`hostPath`/a powerful SA mount/a sidecar into every future pod
  (incl. control-plane, unless namespace-excluded) → `node_escape`/`cluster_admin`; or
  rewrites incoming `RoleBinding`/pod objects. A **validating** webhook with
  `clientConfig.url` → attacker endpoint streams every matching AdmissionReview
  (Secret/ConfigMap `CREATE` bodies) out of band → `kube_system_secrets`. Precision:
  webhooks see the *request* object, so this taps Secrets *written through* admission,
  not a bulk read at rest; TokenRequest `.status.token` is populated post-admission so
  it is **not** captured. Cluster-scoped resource → must come from a ClusterRole.
- **D2 · MutatingAdmissionPolicy (`KUBE-PRIVESC-019`, *novel N1*).** The webhookless
  CEL/JSONPatch equivalent (`admissionregistration.k8s.io`, alpha v1.32) — no external
  TLS endpoint, mutation logic stored in etcd, executed in-process. `create` on
  `mutatingadmissionpolicies`+`…bindings` → same privileged-pod / token-mount injection,
  stealthier. Tier A on RBAC; feature-gate state is unknown offline (don't gate on it).
- **D3 · De-harden an existing policy engine.** `update`/`patch`/`delete` on
  `{mutating,validating}webhookconfigurations` or VAP/MAP `…policies`/`…bindings` flips
  `failurePolicy Fail→Ignore`, narrows `namespaceSelector`/`objectSelector` to exempt the
  attacker, empties `rules`, or deletes the config — neutering Kyverno/Gatekeeper/PSA-
  replacement enforcement so a previously-blocked privileged pod admits. Enabler edge →
  re-unlocks `node_escape`.
- **D4 · ParamRef / policy-as-data tampering (*novel N4/N15*).** A subject need not touch
  the policy or binding: writing the **param object** a VAP/MAP `paramRef` trusts (a
  ConfigMap/CRD) steers the CEL verdict, or `parameterNotFoundAction: Allow` + deleting the
  param fails it open. Correction verified: you **cannot** shadow a `Deny` binding with a new
  permissive one (bindings AND-combine / union `validationActions`) — only patching the
  existing binding's `paramRef` or param works. Tier B (needs VAP/bindings + paramRef
  collection).
- **D5 · CRD conversion webhook (*critic add*).** `create`/`patch` on
  `customresourcedefinitions` carrying `spec.conversion.strategy: Webhook` points the
  apiserver's per-read/write conversion call at an attacker Service — an admission-MITM-
  equivalent intercept the sweep's webhook rules miss.

---

## E. Ingress / network / MITM layer

| Ref | Vector | Signal | Gain | Tier |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| KUBE-INGRESS-NGINX-001 | Ingress annotation injection → ingress-controller RCE → inherit its SA (cluster-wide `secrets` read for TLS) | create/patch `ingresses` (networking.k8s.io) + ingress-nginx controller pod present whose SA reads secrets cluster-wide | `kube_system_secrets` → `cluster_admin` | B |
| KUBE-INGRESS-NGINX-001 (unauth) | **IngressNightmare** CVE-2025-1974 (+1097/1098/24513/24514): POST a crafted AdmissionReview to the admission webhook over the pod network, `nginx -t` `dlopen`s a staged .so → **zero-RBAC** RCE | controller image tag `< v1.11.5` / `1.12.0`; ingress-nginx `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` present; no NetworkPolicy fronting the webhook port | `kube_system_secrets`/`cluster_admin` | B (version+webhook) / C (true reachability) |
| KUBE-CONFIGMAP-COREDNS-WRITE-001 | Write `kube-system/coredns` Corefile → `forward`/`rewrite`/`template` in-cluster names to attacker IP → DNS MITM | update/patch `configmaps` in kube-system (`resourceNames [coredns]`) | `traffic_intercept` → credential/token theft | A |
| KUBE-INGRESS-GATEWAY-001/002 | Gateway API: attach `HTTPRoute` to a shared listener (`allowedRoutes.from: All`), or over-broad `ReferenceGrant` exposing cross-ns Secrets | create/update `httproutes`/`gateways`/`referencegrants` (gateway.networking.k8s.io) | `traffic_intercept`; cross-ns TLS disclosure | A (grant) / B (listener/ReferenceGrant spec) |

(Service `externalIPs` and Endpoints/EndpointSlice hijack are the RBAC-primitive rows
`KUBE-PRIVESC-021/022` in §B; they also feed the `traffic_intercept` sink.)

---

## F. Node / kubelet / PKI escalation

- **Static-pod manifest drop (`KUBE-ESCAPE-STATICPOD-001`).** Writable hostPath to
  `/etc/kubernetes/manifests` runs arbitrary mirror pods with **zero admission** — distinct
  from generic `/etc` read. Pair with A2 to chain node-root → control-plane.
- **Control-plane PKI theft → offline forgery.** Readable `/etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.key`
  → forge `system:masters` client certs; **`sa.key`** (`--service-account-signing-key-file`)
  → forge tokens for **any** SA including kube-system controllers, no API call, no expiry
  (*critic #1*). **`front-proxy-ca.key`** → forge the requestheader cert, set
  `X-Remote-Group: system:masters` to any aggregated API (*critic #4*).
- **Bootstrap token → `system:node`** (`KUBE-PRIVESC-026`, §B). Node-authorizer scope, not
  cluster-admin — correctly a node-scoped `kube_system_secrets` read.
- **Signer `sign`/`approve`** (`KUBE-PRIVESC-024`, §B). The controller-side half of PKI,
  never modeled.
- **Impersonate `system:nodes`** (A6). → `TargetNodeIdentity`; second hop (which pods run
  where) needs a pod→node→SA join to emulate the Node authorizer.
- **Control-plane scheduling amplifier (`KUBE-ESCAPE-CONTROLPLANE-SCHED-001`, *critic #6*).**
  A PodSpec tolerating `node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane:NoSchedule` or pinning
  `nodeName`/`nodeSelector` to a master turns a benign hostPath into control-plane PKI/etcd
  access. The pod-escape edge never inspects tolerations/nodeName.
- **Poison trust ConfigMaps (`KUBE-CONFIGMAP-TRUST-001`, *critic #13*).** Write
  `kube-system/extension-apiserver-authentication` (requestheader CA list),
  `kube-root-ca.crt`, or `kubelet-config`/`kubeadm-config` → add an attacker CA → forge
  `system:masters` to aggregated APIs.
- **Version-gated node CVEs.** `KUBE-VERSION-CVE-2025-4563` (NodeRestriction DRA bypass on
  apiserver 1.32.0–1.32.5 / 1.33.0–1.33.1, Low/informational).

## G. Storage / volume escapes

| Ref | Vector | Signal | Tier |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| KUBE-PRIVESC-027 | Attacker-minted hostPath PV + PVC + pod (PSA-blind, create-time) | create `persistentvolumes`+`persistentvolumeclaims`+`pods` | A |
| KUBE-PRIVESC-028 | StorageClass → hostPath provisioner (`pathPattern` traversal; local-path-provisioner CVE-2025-62878) | create `storageclasses` (+ provisioner image/version) | A/B |
| KUBE-ESCAPE-SUBPATH-001 | `subPath`/`subPathExpr` symlink-exchange bind-mounts host paths (CVE-2021-25741, CVE-2017-1002101) | `volumeMounts[].subPath` set, **not** readOnly, on a writable volume (emptyDir/PVC/hostPath) + kubelet version < patch | B (kubelet version join) |
| KUBE-ESCAPE-CSI-001 | CSI ephemeral inline volume / FlexVolume runs a root plugin, bypassing hostPath-keyed PSA | `volumes[].csi.driver` / `volumes[].flexVolume` on a pod spec (+ host-capable CSIDriver `Ephemeral`) | A (spec) / B (CSIDriver) |
| KUBE-STORAGE-SNAPSHOT-001 | Clone a secret/etcd-bearing PV via VolumeSnapshot, mount the copy (*critic #8*) | create `volumesnapshots`/`volumesnapshotcontents` (snapshot.storage.k8s.io) | B |
| KUBE-STORAGE-SSRF-001 | In-tree provisioner SSRF via StorageClass `resturl`/endpoint params (CVE-2020-8555 class) (*critic #9*) | create `storageclasses` with a risky in-tree provisioner + URL param | B |

## H. Pod-spec escape vectors not inspected

| Ref | Field | Effect | Tier |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| KUBE-ESCAPE-WINHOSTPROCESS-001 | `securityContext.windowsOptions.hostProcess: true` (+`runAsUserName: NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`) | Windows-node root — the Windows analog of `privileged`, entirely unscored today | A |
| KUBE-PODSEC-SELINUX-001 | `seLinuxOptions.type: spc_t`/`unconfined_t` (or user/role set) | Removes SELinux confinement on enforcing nodes (Baseline-forbidden). Amplifier. | A |
| KUBE-PODSEC-APPARMOR-001 | `appArmorProfile.type: Unconfined` (or legacy annotation) | Removes the default syscall barrier that blocks mount/`unshare` escapes (CVE-2022-0492). Companion to the covered seccomp-Unconfined check. Amplifier. | A |
| KUBE-PODSEC-HOSTPORT-001 | `containers[].ports[].hostPort` | Ingress path invisible to NetworkPolicy; squat a node-local/NodePort service. Lateral, not node-root. | A |
| KUBE-PODSEC-SYSCTL-001 | `securityContext.sysctls[]` non-namespaced (`kernel.msg*/shm*/sem`) | Signals a loosened node; DoS/resource primitive. Low. | A (signal) / C (payoff) |

## I. Runtime & kernel CVE flags (node version strings, already collected, unparsed)

`Node.Status.NodeInfo.{ContainerRuntimeVersion,KernelVersion,KubeletVersion,OSImage}`
are in every snapshot but no analyzer matches them to CVE bands. These **amplify** any
in-container code-exec source (pod-create, controller-create, compromised image) into
`node_escape` independent of securityContext.

- **KUBE-NODE-RUNTIME-CVE-001** — runc ≤1.1.11 CVE-2024-21626 (Leaky Vessels;
  containerd→runc version is a *proxy* — flag as heuristic), CVE-2019-5736 (`/proc/self/exe`),
  containerd <1.4.3/<1.3.9 CVE-2020-15257 (gate on a hostNetwork pod on that node).
- **KUBE-NODE-KERNEL-CVE-001** — CVE-2022-0847 Dirty Pipe (no cap/userns needed — flag
  unconditionally in-band), CVE-2022-0185 fsconfig & CVE-2022-0492 cgroup-v1 release_agent
  (both need unprivileged userns / AppArmor-unconfined — gate accordingly).
- **KUBE-VERSION-CVE-2022-3172** — aggregated-API SSRF/credential-forward, apiserver
  ≤1.25.0/1.24.0-4/… ; **KUBE-INGRESS-NGINX-001** version gate (§E).

## J. Cloud identity beyond EKS (+ the cloud-return edge)

Mirror the shipped IRSA edge for GKE/AKS, then close A5's return gap.

| Ref | Signal | Sink | Tier |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| KUBE-CLOUD-GKE-WI-001 | SA annotation `iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account` + a pod/controller referencing it | new `TargetGCPServiceAccount` (admin heuristic on `-compute@developer` / `Owner`/`Editor`) | A (origin) / C (GCP-side binding) |
| KUBE-CLOUD-AZWI-001 | SA annotation `azure.workload.identity/client-id` + pod label `azure.workload.identity/use: "true"` | new `TargetAzureManagedIdentity` | A (origin) / C (Entra federation) |
| KUBE-CLOUD-GKE-WI-SAMENESS-001 | create `namespaces`+`serviceaccounts`+`pods` → recreate a `NAMESPACE/KSA` tuple matching an existing WI binding ("identity sameness") | `TargetGCPServiceAccount` | A (grant) / C |
| KUBE-CLOUD-\*-RETURN-001 | cloud-admin IAM node re-enters the cluster: GKE `roles/container.admin`/`clusterAdmin` → `get-credentials`; AKS `Contributor`/AKS-Admin → `listClusterAdminCredential`; EKS `eks:AssociateAccessPolicy` (Access Entries) | `cluster_admin`/`system_masters` | C (IAM policy data out-of-snapshot) |

Also: GCP SA impersonation chains (`iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator`/`actAs`, cross-project
`GenerateAccessToken` hops) are origin-detectable only (C).

## K. Long escalation chains the current BFS cannot surface

These are the multi-hop paths the user specifically asked for — each combines primitives
above such that **no existing edge sequence connects source to sink**. Grouped;
representative chains shown with the exact structural reason the BFS misses them. All 20
are in the research dataset; the marquee ones:

### K1 — Confused-deputy laundered into node-root (real-world, 5 hops)
`tenant/dev-deployer` (no `pods` verb) `--create Kustomization→attacker OCI source-->`
`kustomize-controller` (cluster-admin) `--applies a privileged kube-system DaemonSet-->`
hostPath `/`+privileged `--escape-->` `node_escape` `--read /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf &
etcd on a control-plane node-->` `cluster_admin`.
**Missed because:** no confused-deputy edge (A3) *and* `node_escape` is terminal (A2) — two
independent misses stack.

### K2 — Double-controller laundering (realistic, 6 hops)
`ci/pipeline-submitter` (create `workflows`, no `pods`) `--Workflow spec.serviceAccountName=
gitops-deployer-->` executor pod runs as `gitops-deployer` `--steal token-->` `--create
Kustomization-->` `kustomize-controller` `--applies a ClusterRoleBinding→attacker-->`
`cluster_admin`.
**Missed because:** the CI-CRD SA-override edge is unmodeled (subject lacks `pods`, so
`-001/-004` never fire), *and* SA-token-theft transitivity isn't represented, *and* the Flux
confused-deputy edge is absent.

### K3 — Create mutating webhook → tap the write path → node-escape (real-world, 5–6 hops)
`create mutatingwebhookconfigurations` `--register wildcard webhook-->` apiserver POSTs every
AdmissionReview to attacker `--inject privileged/hostPath sidecar into a kube-system pod-->`
`node_escape` `--steal kubelet cert-->` `cluster_admin`.
**Missed because:** `addEdgesForRule` has no `admissionregistration.k8s.io` case (D1), and the
injected sidecar is synthesized at admission — invisible to a static pod scan.

### K4 — Namespace-admin → cluster-admin via a co-located controller (real-world, 4 hops)
`namespace_admin:apps` `--implies create Flux CR / steal any SA token in apps-->`
`flux-system` controller SA (or a co-located privileged SA) `--its cluster-scoped edges-->`
`cluster_admin`.
**Missed because:** `namespace_admin` is a terminal sink (A1) — BFS halts and never expands the
implied token-theft/CRD-create capability.

### K5 — Webhook-backend hijack via EndpointSlice (realistic, 5 hops)
`namespace_admin:security-system` (or an `endpointslices`-writer) `--repoint the selector-less
Service backing a MutatingWebhookConfiguration-->` apiserver→webhook traffic redirected `--forge
admit responses / capture AdmissionReview Secret bodies-->` `--inject privileged pod / forge
RoleBinding-->` `cluster_admin`.
**Missed because:** no `endpoints`/`endpointslices` edge (A4/§B-021), Services & EndpointSlices
aren't collected, and nothing correlates an endpoint-writer with an in-namespace webhook Service.

### K6 — Service externalIPs → kube-proxy MITM of apiserver/IMDS (real-world, 5 hops)
`create services` `--spec.externalIPs=[apiserver ClusterIP | 169.254.169.254]-->` kube-proxy
MITM on every node `--capture a privileged token / node IAM creds-->` `cluster_admin` (or
`aws-iam` on the IMDS variant). **Missed because:** no `services`/externalIPs edge and no MITM
sink (A4).

### K7 — Ingress annotation injection → controller-SA cluster secret read (real-world, 5 hops)
`create ingresses` `--malicious snippet / IngressNightmare-->` ingress-nginx RCE `--read the
controller SA token (cluster-wide `secrets`)-->` `kube_system_secrets` → `cluster_admin`.
**Missed because:** Ingresses aren't collected, `ingresses` is not a modeled verb, and no edge
links an ingress-writer to the controller SA's secret-read power.

### K8 — PKI chains to `system_masters` (realistic, 3–4 hops)
Three distinct, all unmodeled: **signer `sign`** on `kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client` →
directly write a signed `O=system:masters` cert (C14); **bootstrap-token** → `system:node` →
pod-token theft (C13); **static-pod drop** on a control-plane node → steal `ca.key` → offline
forgery (C15). **Missed because:** the CSR model only covers create+`/approval`; `signers`/`sign`
and the bootstrap/static-pod primitives have no edge; `node_escape` is terminal.

### K9 — Cloud round-trips (real-world/realistic, 4–5 hops)
GKE: pod → WI token → GSA `roles/container.admin` → `get-credentials` → `cluster_admin` (C17).
EKS: pod → IMDS node role → `sts:AssumeRole` → `eks:AssociateAccessPolicy` (Access Entry) →
`system_masters` (C18). AKS: pod → IMDS MI → `listClusterAdminCredential` → `cluster_admin`
(C19). Plus C20: Argo SA-override → IRSA → IAM self-escalate → write `aws-auth` → `system_masters`.
**Missed because:** GKE/AKS unmodeled (A5), external IAM nodes are terminal (no return edge), and
the CI-CRD SA-override entry edge is absent.

## L. Novel / speculative vectors (survived 2-of-3 plausibility voting)

Under-documented or forward-looking primitives most scanners — and most write-ups — miss.
Detectability and the load-bearing caveat are stated honestly.

| # | Vector | Novelty | Detect | Key caveat |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| N1 | **MutatingAdmissionPolicy** webhookless etcd-native mutating tap (§D2) | undocumented-but-real | full (RBAC) | feature-gate state unknown offline |
| N2 | `pods/ephemeralcontainers` inject into a **running** privileged pod (steal its token/PID) | undocumented-but-real | full | needs a high-value running pod in scope (`-013` covers the verb but not this framing) |
| N3 | **ClusterTrustBundle / PodCertificate** trust-anchor poisoning → mTLS peer impersonation | undocumented-but-real | full (grant) | workload must project the bundle; signer-scoped needs `attest` |
| N4/N15 | **VAP paramRef / policy-as-data** tampering (write the param, not the policy) | undocumented-but-real | partial | policy must actually derive its verdict from mutable params |
| N5/N7 | **DRA** `ResourceClaim`/`DeviceClass`/`adminAccess` → driver CDI host injection | speculative | partial | hinges on a driver that maps unsanitised claim config to CDI mounts/hooks |
| N6 | **Controller-token laundering**: `update` a privileged controller's Deployment (or create a pod as its SA in-ns) → inherit its token | undocumented-but-real | full | SA token must be auto-mounted; SA genuinely high-value |
| N8 | **KubeVirt** VMI as a PodSecurity-bypass deputy → privileged virt-launcher | undocumented-but-real | partial | KubeVirt installed with controller-SA PSA exemption |
| N9 | **Karpenter** NodeClaim `userData`/AMI/instanceProfile injection → attacker node | undocumented-but-real | partial | cloud IAM out-of-snapshot |
| N10 | **Image-policy trust-root** tampering (sigstore/Kyverno-verifyImages) → supply-chain bypass | speculative | partial | orthogonal to PSA — still needs a separate privileged-pod control to node-escape |
| N11 | **`pods/binding`** scheduler bypass onto a tainted control-plane node → PKI theft (§B-030) | undocumented-but-real | partial | control-plane co-residency unconditional; hostPath+root needs no PSA |
| N12 | **Evict-the-webhook-backend race**: `pods/eviction` + `failurePolicy: Ignore` fail-open window | speculative | partial | only bypasses the fail-open webhook's own controls, **not** the RBAC authorizer |
| N13 | **PriorityClass `globalDefault` flip** + preemption steering | undocumented-but-real | partial | caps at 1e9; can't preempt system-critical infra |
| N14 | **Node label/taint patch** → attract a privileged DaemonSet onto an attacker node | undocumented-but-real | partial | attacker must control the destination kubelet to harvest the relocated token |

## M. Additional gaps flagged by the completeness critic

Beyond the 57 verified above, the critic surfaced 13 under-covered classes; the ones not
already folded into A–L:

- **OpenShift SecurityContextConstraints** — `use` on `scc/privileged` (etc.) is the
  RBAC-inferable analog of PSA-bypass → `node_escape`. Entire authorization model absent
  (`KUBE-OPENSHIFT-SCC-001`).
- **Legacy PSP `use`** — first-class graph edge `use podsecuritypolicies/<permissive>` →
  `node_escape`, not just a docs footnote.
- **`get pods/log`** (scrape logged tokens) and **`pods/proxy`/`services/proxy`** (reach
  dashboards/IMDS bypassing NetworkPolicy) — RBAC-inferable recon-to-cred verbs
  (`KUBE-PRIVESC-RECON-001`).
- **CRD conversion webhook** (D5), **SA signing-key / front-proxy CA theft** (§F),
  **VolumeSnapshot clone-mount** & **provisioner SSRF** (§G), **Crossplane/OLM/Rancher-Fleet**
  catalog entries (§C), **trust-ConfigMap poisoning** (§F) — captured above.

## N. Proposed new sinks, edge types & rule-ID allocation (summary)

### New sinks
| Sink | Represents | Fed by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TargetTrafficIntercept` | MITM / credential capture in transit | externalIPs, endpoints/slices, coredns, APIService, webhook exfil, ClusterTrustBundle |
| `TargetNodeIdentity` | `system:node:<name>` (Node-authorizer scope) | bootstrap token, impersonate system:nodes |
| `TargetGCPServiceAccount` / `TargetAzureManagedIdentity` | bound cloud identity | GKE WI / AKS WI annotations |
| `TargetAdmissionBypass` | policy-engine de-hardening (enabler) | webhook/VAP patch, paramRef tamper, evict-backend race |

### Structural changes (unlock the most chains)
1. Make `namespace_admin` **traversable** (A1) → K4, K7 tail.
2. Make `node_escape` a conditional **intermediate** with control-plane onward edges (A2) → K1, K8.
3. Add the **confused-deputy** edge family + operator catalog (A3, §C) → K1, K2, K4.
4. Add the **traffic_intercept** sink (A4) → K5, K6.
5. Give external cloud-IAM nodes **outbound return edges** + GKE/AKS parsers (A5) → K9.
6. `resourceName`-aware **impersonation** with a node-identity sink (A6) → K8.

### Rule-ID allocation
New `KUBE-PRIVESC-018…033` (§B), `KUBE-CONFUSED-DEPUTY-*` (§C), `KUBE-ESCAPE-{WINHOSTPROCESS,
SUBPATH,CSI,STATICPOD,CONTROLPLANE-SCHED}-001`, `KUBE-PODSEC-{SELINUX,APPARMOR,HOSTPORT,SYSCTL}-001`,
`KUBE-NODE-{RUNTIME,KERNEL}-CVE-001`, `KUBE-INGRESS-{NGINX,GATEWAY}-001`, `KUBE-CLOUD-{GKE-WI,
AZWI,*-RETURN}-001`, `KUBE-CONFIGMAP-{COREDNS-WRITE,TRUST}-001`, `KUBE-PKI-{SAKEY,FRONTPROXY}-001`,
`KUBE-STORAGE-{SNAPSHOT,SSRF}-001`, `KUBE-CRD-CONVERSION-WEBHOOK-001`, `KUBE-OPENSHIFT-SCC-001`.
(The research agents collapsed many onto a placeholder `KUBE-PRIVESC-018`; the numbering above
is the deconflicted allocation.)

### Suggested implementation order (impact × cost)
1. **Tier-A RBAC edges on current data** — `-018` (webhooks), `-019` (MAP), `-024` (signer sign),
   `-026` (bootstrap token), `-027` (create-PV hostPath), `-031` (secret-mount read), `-032`
   (DaemonSet hijack), impersonate-subresources (`-025`), `KUBE-ESCAPE-WINHOSTPROCESS-001`.
   Highest value, zero collector work.
2. **Structural unlocks** — A1 (namespace_admin traversable) and A3 (confused-deputy catalog);
   biggest chain coverage per change.
3. **Collector extensions (Tier B)** — Services + Endpoints/EndpointSlices (→ `-021/-022`, K5/K6),
   Ingresses (K7), APIServices (`-020`), VAP/bindings+paramRef (D4), node version parsing (§I).
4. **Cloud (A5)** — GKE/AKS parsers + return-edge tables (K9); Tier-C fidelity, but parity with
   the shipped EKS edge.
