			"Since Kubernetes v1.22, Bound ServiceAccount Tokens (KEP-1205) replaced this model: the kubelet projects a *new* token into the pod's filesystem with a short TTL (default 1h) and the token is bound to the pod object, so deleting the pod invalidates the token. v1.24 stopped auto-creating these legacy Secret tokens, and v1.27+ ships the `LegacyServiceAccountTokenCleaner` controller that removes unused ones automatically. A legacy token Secret today is either an artifact of a pre-1.24 cluster, a manually-created `serviceAccountToken` Secret, or a controller that explicitly created one — none of which carry the bind-to-pod, time-bounded properties of projected tokens.\n\n"+
			"The risk profile: a leaked legacy token grants whatever permissions its ServiceAccount has, *forever*, with no automatic revocation. It survives Pod restarts, node reboots, audit events, and rotation of the SA itself. Detection of misuse requires explicit audit-log monitoring against the SA name; rotation requires deleting the Secret and reissuing.",

		Description: "The CoreDNS Corefile in `kube-system/coredns` contains directives that change DNS behavior in ways that warrant explicit review: `rewrite` directives mutate query names or response data, and `forward` directives that send queries to external resolvers (`8.8.8.8`, `1.1.1.1`, `tls://...`) bypass the cluster's authoritative records and the cluster's egress firewall.\n\n" +
			"Two threat models matter here. (1) **Defensive misconfiguration**: a `rewrite` rule that maps an internal name to an external one can cause apps to talk to attacker-controlled hosts when the rule's intent was something else (typo, copy-paste from a tutorial). External `forward` to public resolvers means DNS queries (which often contain pod names, namespace names, internal service topology) leave the cluster perimeter unencrypted to a third-party operator with no DPA. (2) **Active subversion**: an attacker with write access to the `kube-system/coredns` ConfigMap (a far rarer condition, but exactly the prize for `KUBE-PRIVESC-005` chains) can add a `rewrite` rule that redirects `*.svc.cluster.local` to attacker pods, then capture every connection that does not pin TLS — full cluster-wide MITM. CoreDNS reloads the Corefile automatically; no operator action needed.\n\n" +
			"This is the most common active-subversion path discussed in DNS-rebinding-in-Kubernetes research: the CoreDNS ConfigMap is structurally a one-shot to compromise resolution for every pod, and clusters often grant `kube-system` ConfigMap write to addon installers, helm-controllers, and network operators that the security team hasn't audited.",
		Impact: "If the Corefile is malicious, every DNS query in the cluster can be silently redirected — including queries for in-cluster services, cloud APIs, and external SaaS — enabling MITM and data exfiltration. If the Corefile is merely sloppy, internal DNS names may leak to public resolvers.",
