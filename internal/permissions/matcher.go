// Package permissions - matcher.go: the shared RBAC capability matcher used by the
// rbac, serviceaccount, and privesc analyzers. It answers one question - "does this
// effective rule authorize <verb> on <(apiGroup, resource)>?" - with the three
// pieces of RBAC precision the analyzers used to skip:
//
//  1. apiGroup awareness. A PolicyRule authorizes a request only when it covers the
//     request's API group AND resource AND verb. Matching on the bare resource name
//     (ignoring the group) mis-fires on custom resources that reuse a core name -
//     e.g. a CRD `secrets.example.com` in group `example.com` is not the core
//     `secrets`. Grants requires both the group and the resource to line up.
//
//  2. resourceNames awareness. A rule with a non-empty ResourceNames applies only to
//     those named object instances. RBAC cannot scope a request that has no object
//     name at authorization time - `list`, `watch`, `deletecollection`, and `create`
//     on a top-level resource - so a name-scoped rule does NOT authorize those verbs
//     (Kubernetes documents "you cannot restrict create or deletecollection requests
//     by their resource name"). Verbs that act on a named object (`get`, `update`,
//     `patch`, `delete`, `bind`, `escalate`, `impersonate`, and `create` on a
//     subresource whose parent name rides in the URL, like `pods/exec`) still match,
//     scoped to the named objects.
//
//  3. wildcard handling on every axis: "*" in the rule's groups, resources, or verbs
//     matches anything on that axis. The resources axis has one more form: "*/sub"
//     matches the subresource "sub" of every resource (see coversResource). The verbs
//     axis has no partial wildcard: a prefixed verb such as `impersonate:user-info` or
//     `associated-node:update` is one more opaque verb string, matched exactly or by
//     "*".
//
// The three axes follow VerbMatches, APIGroupMatches, ResourceMatches, and
// ResourceNameMatches in kubernetes/kubernetes pkg/apis/rbac/v1/evaluation_helpers.go,
// which is the code the RBAC authorizer runs.
